            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BOth Equity and Intereſt do give you a peculiar claim to this off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of my weak Labours, it being born in your Houſe, and drawing its firſt breath in your famous City. 'Twas with you I had the occaſion, and from your Self the practical encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to treat on this Subject; while under your roof I enjoyed for divers weeks the advantage of your converſe, and beheld in your expreſſions and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation a fair diſplay of this Heavenly Trade. This cheriſhed my hopes that a diſcourſe of this nature might find or help to make more ſuch Traders in your Auguſt
<pb facs="tcp:132285:3"/> and Merchandizing City: A place (among its many Ornaments) made happy with Goſpel enjoyments, and the lovers of Truth and Peace. 'Tis Religion is the honour and proſperity of a People, <hi>It lays their foundation with Agates, and makes their borders of pleaſant ſtones,</hi> Iſa. 54. 'Tis like the Crown of <hi>Solomon, with which his Mother crowned him in the day of his eſpouſals, and in the day of the gladneſs of his heart,</hi> Cant. 3. 11. This gives them <hi>Peace within their walls, and Proſperity within their Palaces,</hi> Pſal. 122. 7. It brings down a bleſſing on their Basket and Stores, <hi>fills their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with all precious and pleaſant riches,</hi> Prov. 24. 4. And decay in this Heavenly Trade, is doubtleſs one reaſon of thoſe waſts in mens earthly Trades: There is no ſuch way for men to thrive in their own intereſts, as to be faithful to God's intereſt; As 'twas ſaid of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that <hi>by ſetting up</hi> Pompey's <hi>Image, he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his own,</hi> whereas a decay of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs brings a Moth on mens earthly Trades alſo: <hi>Hoſ,</hi> 5. 11, 12, Ephraim is oppreſſed and broken in judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he willingly walked after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, therefore will I be unto
<pb facs="tcp:132285:3"/> 
               <hi>Ephraim a Moth, and to the houſe of Judah as rottenneſs. Gregory</hi> gives this reaſon why <hi>Dives</hi> was tormented in his Tongue, becauſe he talk'd much of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but practiſed little, <hi>Verba legis in ore tenuit quae opere ſervare Contempſit.</hi> We live in an age of much talking of God, but of little walking with God; Mens tongues are tipt with Heaven, but their hearts and feet ſunk into the World, and are full of Pride, Vanity, and Deceit. What was ſaid of <hi>Diogenes Synopenſis,</hi> That <hi>in Opinion he was a Stoick, but in Converſation an Epicure,</hi> may be ſadly reflected on many Profeſſors in this Age, who eſpouſe ſtrict Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but lead looſe Lives, and only Treat for Heaven, but Trade for Earth. But Sir, <hi>You have not ſo learned Chriſt, or received this Spirit which is of the world; but that which is of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 12. Your devotedneſs to the Lord making your earthly Intereſts ſubſervient to things above, with your Zeal, Courage, and Conſtancy in the way of God, and natural care for the things of his Glory, do beſpeak you to be a Trader of another Countrey, whoſe work and wages are above; And certainly whatever men
<pb facs="tcp:132285:4"/> think, a walking with God in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and a conſcientious care in every thing to pleaſe him, will one day appear to be the greateſt interest even in their eyes who now deſpiſe it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there at preſent any thing in the ways of God which Souls have cauſe to be aſhamed of, however cloathed with Calumny and Scorn by men; nor can they who walk in them in Truth, be deprived of any real interest by the utmoſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of thoſe that would run them down, And were there no other Argument to perſwade men to the choice and perſuit of Godlineſs, this were ſufficient, even that relief gracious Souls find from a reflexion on their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs, to bear them up under their greateſt ſufferings; yea, that ſerenity, peace, and ſweet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence of Spirit which ſincerity affords them under the moſt dreadful iſſues which divine pleaſure may allot them here. It muſt needs ſet Religion above all other Intereſts (its Enemies themſelves being Judges, if they would be rational) that the worſt things of Holineſs, even then when Believers are under the ſaddeſt Circumſtances, are choſen and preferred by them above the
<pb facs="tcp:132285:4"/> beſt things of the world; yea, they are thought a good bargain when purchaſed with their greateſt Sufferings. Surely humour will not engage ſuch who know the uſefulneſs of earthly Comforts, and have leaſt reaſon to be prodigal of them, to expoſe themſelves, and their deareſt concerns in the world unto ruine, but for what they are perſwaded, is far better. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 34. Nor can it be thought obſtinacy or hypocriſie in thoſe who know their own hearts, and the terrors of the Lord, to perſiſt in thoſe ways that would coſt them their earthly All, and lay them open to divine wrath too, ſhould they be falſe and diſobedient. Certainly, did not prejudice and paſſion blind mens eyes, the calm exerciſe of their own light would reſtrain them from ſuch an uncharitable cenſure of thoſe that deſire to fear God, though they walk in ſome ways different from their underſtanding, while they labour to approve their integrity to God and men, and are found faithful to that meaſure of light they have received. But poſſibly this Piece may not fall into ſuch hands, or be permitted long under their eye: My hopes, at leaſt my deſires are, that it may proſper with thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb facs="tcp:132285:5"/> better things; And if it ſhall pleaſe the Lord (who ſometimes uſes clay and ſpittle, and Goats hair, and counts the things that are not as if they were) to make this of any ſervice to your Self and Family, and unto thoſe who profeſs his Name in your City, for whom I have ſo high reſpect in the Lord, it will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly compenſate the labour, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the deſign of him who is and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to approve himſelf</p>

<pb facs="tcp:132285:7"/> the likelieſt way to That is through the <hi>plains</hi> of <hi>Intelligible truth.</hi> I cannot expect that Diſcourſe ſhould lead others towards Heaven, that has not its ſelf drained and refined from Earth: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not in this any thing that may pleaſe thy carnal mind, but what may profit thy teachable and obedient Soul; and before thou aſcendeſt the Throne to judge it, take the Balance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary and weigh it: Be adviſed to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſuch Readers who onely view the Title, read the Epiſtle, glance a little on the Book, and if they find not ſomething ſingular and pleaſing their curious Fancy, lay it aſide; this ſhews a full Stomach but an empty Soul, and is a Practice that overturns the Writers pains and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders profit; be perſwaded to read it throughly and impartially, and weigh it ſeriouſly, and thou mayeſt find ſomething that concerns either thy Underſtanding, Affection, Conſcience, or Converſation.</p>

            <p>If thou be one who driveſt furiouſly after the World, purſuing thy earthly Intereſt with greedineſs, neglecting the things that concern thy <hi>peace,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Concerns of Heaven and thy immmortal Soul to the poor and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trifles of this World; here thou wilt find reaſons to convince thee of that <hi>folly,</hi> and helps to looſen thy heart from that enſaring Soul ruining bondage.</p>
            <p>If thou meeteſt with Rebukes upon thy earthly Intereſts, and croſſes on thy Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and undertakings in the World, this Book will help thee to find out the Cauſe of thy Diſappointments, and thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Moths on thy Eſtate, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct

            <p>4ly, Walk in <hi>Love</hi> as <hi>Chriſt hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you:</hi> This is the <hi>life of Heaven,</hi> and <hi>beginning</hi> of that <hi>Excellent glory</hi> which ſhall never be <hi>removed;</hi> there is nothing does make thee more like to God, more <hi>near</hi> and <hi>dear</hi> to him, and more fit for his uſe than this <hi>Grace of Love:</hi> Let your Affections be extended as large as the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> of them; unto <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Word, Ways</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> love <hi>God</hi> to <hi>obey him;</hi> his <hi>Ways</hi> to <hi>walk in them,</hi> his <hi>People</hi> to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them,</hi> to <hi>ſympathize</hi> with them, to <hi>mourn</hi> over them in their <hi>ſufferings,</hi> to <hi>help</hi> them in their <hi>neceſſities,</hi> to <hi>rejoyce</hi> with them in their <hi>conſolations,</hi> counting their <hi>mercies</hi> your own, which is no eaſie

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not an idle ſpeculative, but a lively operative knowledge, which conſiſts of an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the mind, and an infuſion of faith and ſpiritual knowledge. <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> calls it, <note n="a" place="bottom">

            <p>Now this Wiſdome is not onely ſpeculative, taking in the notion of truth, and pleaſing the mind with refreſhing views of things excellent; but practical, which diſpoſes the ſoul to a frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, ſo revealed to the eye of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to the obedience of all thoſe counſels opened in order to it.

Job</hi> having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the wonderful Wiſdome of God in the works of Creation, beyond all the ſearches of humane underſtanding, he tells them what is that Wiſdome which God requires of man, not to ſcrew into thoſe unfathom'd deeps and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of divine works in the Creation; not to feed on abſtruſe notions of things that concern them not; but this is true Wiſdome, to fear God, to ſerve and obey him, and to depart from iniquity; So <hi>Deut. 4. 5, 6. Behold I have taught you Statutes and Judgements, keep therefore, and do them, for this is your Wiſdome and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſight of the Nations, which ſhall hear of all theſe Statutes, and ſay, Surely this great Nation is a wiſe and an underſtanding people.

            <p>Firſt, The Scriptures will tell you, there are no wares like heavenly wares, <hi>Deut. 32. 32. Their Rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themſelves being Judges. His loving-kindneſs is better than life, Pſal. 63. 3. And the light of his countenance, than the encreaſes of corn, and wine, and oyl, Pſal. 4. 6, 6. The Law of thy mouth is better to me than thouſands of gold and ſilver, Pſal. 119. 72. Tryed faith much better than gold that periſheth, 1 Pet. 1. 7. One day in God's Courts better than a thouſand elſewhere, Pſa. 84. 10. None in Heaven like to God, nor any on earth in compariſon of him, Pſal.</hi> 73. 25. To make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the ſoul is the one thing needful; to enjoy Chriſt and ſpiritual things is the better part that ſhall never be taken away, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 42. The Kingdom of God is the chiefeſt thing to be ſought for in the firſt place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. firſt in affection, and firſt in time: Multitude of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies might be produced from Scripture to atteſt this truth, the Heavenly Trade is the beſt Trade; no goods like heavenly goods: what do you trade for here? is it for more than life you plot, you work for? you gain no more here than meat, drink, rayment, money, land, credit, and the like, which onely tend to life; but the favour of God is better than life: one gracious look, one whiſper of peace from God, weighs down all thoſe: riches, pleaſures, honours, do not make a happy man or woman; the Scripture never reports ſuch bleſſed as have the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of theſe things, but rather miſerable and unhappy, obnoxious to more ſnares and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; but godlineſs makes a bleſſed man, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:132285:23"/> pardon of ſin a happy man, in God's account, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1, 1, 2. and 32. 1. whoſe teſtimony is truth it ſelf, and to be relied on beyond all the grounds of blinded opinion, and falſe hopes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Experience aſſures men of this truth; that heavenly things are the beſt things: come to a Soul that hath tried both; one who hath had all that the World could afford on the one hand, and hath alſo experienced the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and ſpiritual things, and he will tell you of ſpiritual things, as <hi>David</hi> did of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi>'s Sword: <hi>There is none like them 1 Sam.</hi> 21. 9. And as <hi>Solomon</hi> of the vertuous Wife: Theſe things above excel them all, <hi>Prov. 31. 29. And wiſdom is much better than Gold, and to get under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding rather to be choſen than Silver, Prov.</hi> 16. 16. This was <hi>Solomon</hi>'s experience, who had the largeſt trial of any man, he had Houſes, Vineyards, Gardens, Servants, Silver, Gold, the peculiar treaſures of Kings; Greatneſs, Pleaſure, Muſick, and whatſoever his eyes deſired: and upon all gives this verdict; <hi>That wiſdom excelleth folly as far as light excels darkneſs, Eccleſ.</hi> 24, 13.</p>
            <p>Piety tranſcendeth Pravity; Heaven the World: Purity out-paſſeth Pleaſures, as Light doth Darkneſs: When he ſpeaks of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he tells you; <hi>Theſe are all vanity and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſpirit; he that labours for theſe, labours for the wind, Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 16. and what he ſeeks, finds not; but when he ſpeaks of wiſdom, and ſpiritual things, he is as one that wants words to expreſs their worth: <hi>Wiſdom is better than Rubies, and all the things that may be deſired, are not to be compared to it, Prov. 8. 11. David</hi> was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:132285:23"/> a man who had tried various conditions in the World, he knew what trouble and comfort was, what youth and age was, what poverty and riches were; he had pleaſures, honours, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, with the hearts of his people, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a Kingdom, and yet he tells you, <hi>he had ſeen an end of all perfection: and that the light of God's countenance was better than all, and to be a door-keeper</hi> (a mean place) <hi>in the houſe of God,</hi> was more eligible, than to abide in the tents of wickedneſs: <hi>Pſal. 119. 96. Pſ.</hi> 4. 6. and 84. 10. He chooſes it as his one thing; <hi>To dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the days of his life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in his Temple, Pſal.</hi> 27. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> knew what honour was, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin, and yet upon choice, preferr'd po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty with godlineſs, on the ſide of truth, before all the treaſures of <hi>Egypt; He refuſed to be called</hi> Pharaoh'<hi>s Son, rather chooſing to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt, greater riches than the treaſures in</hi> Egypt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26. He knew the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and grandeur of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, and yet could value a poor perſecuted people, that own'd God, and cleav'd to him, beyond them all: <hi>Happy art thou, O</hi> Iſrael! <hi>who is like to thee? Deut.</hi> 33. 20. He counts God the none-ſuch; <hi>Who is like to thee, O God? Ex.</hi> 15. 11. and Religion the beſt intereſt; <hi>Set your hearts unto all the words, I teſtify; for it is not a vain thing for you, for it is your life, Deut.</hi> 32. 46, 47.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:132285:24"/>
            <p>Ask of <hi>Paul,</hi> and he will tell you what the fruit of ſin, and driving furiouſly againſt Chriſt and his intereſt was, when the Lord Jeſus came to reckon with, and to pay him off in the way to <hi>Damaſcus, Act.</hi> 9. 3, 4. whoſe blow he felt many years after, in Conſcience twitches now and then, 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 1. 13, 15. And upon the ſenſe of that change Grace made on his heart and condition, he tells you, that <hi>whatever he counted gain before, he ſaw now to be loſs for Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. There was a time when he thought his letter-knowledg, blind zeal, birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledges, legal duties, popular applauſe, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers favour, and protection by Power, to be great things; but now he alters his reckoning, and values the knowledg of Chriſt and intereſt in him, and grace derived from the power of his death and reſurrection, to be an excellency that ſtain'd all his former glory.</p>
            <p>The Jaylor once thought it his greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to ſwim with the ſtream, and ſail by the compaſs of the times he lived in, to run down the ways and ſervants of the Lord Jeſus, to obey his warrant, and ſecure the Saints feet in his ſtocks, <hi>Act. 16. ver.</hi> 24, to 34. but when once Grace takes him in hand, and plucks him through the ſtrait-gate of conſcience, terrors, and repentance, into a ſtate of regeneration, then he corrects his errors, and ſees it his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt concern to eſpouſe Chriſt, and to come over into the way of perſecuted godlineſs; then to believe in the Lord Jeſus, to be kind to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and to drive the Trade of deſpiſed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; he thought upon moſt mature conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:132285:24"/> to be worthy of his choice and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. <hi>What treaſures more rich or precious</hi> (ſaid <hi>Agerius,</hi> when a priſoner for Chriſt at <hi>Venice) than everlaſting life? where be greater riches or dignities more honourable than in Heaven? here droppeth the delectable dew, here floweth the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Nector, here runneth the ſweet milk, here is plenty of all good things; I have found a neſt of honey in the entrals of a Lion, in the deep, dark Dungeon; I have found a Paradiſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; where others do weep, I do rejoyce; when others do ſhake and tremble, I do find plenty of ſtrength, and boldneſs; in ſtrait Bonds, and cold Irons, I have reſt:</hi> Fox, <hi>Vol. 2. pag.</hi> 181. Come to ſinners alſo when they lie under Conſcience, terrors, and the armed troops of death and hell invade their guilty hearts, and enquire their opinion concerning the goodneſs of their choice, the advantage of that bargain they have made, in parting with God for the World, in rejecting Chriſt for the Fleſh, in turning their backs on holineſs, for the ſervice of ſin; and their dejected countenances, their gaſtly looks, their unquiet jeſtures, their cries and groans, will ſoon tell you the ſad reſentment of their folly, and bad Trade they have driven in the ways of ſin and death.</p>

            <p>Firſt, Heavenly things are rare, and therefore excellent; ſcarcity enhaunceth the price of things; Diamonds and precious ſtones are dear, becauſe ſcarce, and more rarely had; plenty uſually beats down the price of things, when rarity makes them coſtly; and ſuch are Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wares; they are the greateſt rarity in the world; they are leſs known, more hardly come by, and ſeldomer enjoyed than any thing this earth affords; there are few parts of the world where Wiſdom's goods ever come: How many Countries are there where the Goſpel is not known? or any ſights of God, or things eternal ever had, but ſuch as are diſcernable by the dini light of nature; and of thoſe coaſts which this days ſpring hath viſited, to how few have the brightneſs of this light appeared? few places have the myſteries of the Goſpel opened, or the deep things of God purely, fully and powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached. It hath been the priviledge of this Nation above many, to have a peculiar ſhare of Goſpel diſcoveries and truths, more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually and practically diſcloſed; and yet how few here, or in other parts, have any acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with theſe glorious ſecrets? or arrive to this excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, and Divine Myſteries? what a veil is there on the minds of moſt, under the pureſt adminiſtrations of the Goſpel, that ſeeing, they ſee not; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and yet not affected with the things they know; the ſpiritual beauty, and inward worth of them being hid from their eyes. Moſt hearers (like <hi>Balaam</hi>) ſee heavenly goods with eyes half opened; and hence it is they no more value and purſue them: Could theſe poor, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:132285:25"/> dirty things of the world, be ſo preferred in mens affections and embraces, and ſo much time conſumed upon them, with neglect of God, and things above, if the worth of Wiſdome's Treaſures were truly known and believed? no certainly, we may without breach of charity complain, <hi>Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? Iſa.</hi> 53. 1. They are rare, in that they ſeldome appear in their own worth and excellency to the view of men: few know and believe the worth of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things.</p>
            <p>They are alſo goods that few trade on. It's a rare thing to ſee men much vers'd about hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, and to drive a trade of godlineſs: There are divers poſſibly that barter for ſome of Wiſdome's goods, for knowledge, peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, parts, external duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but few that carry on a full trade of godlineſs: An <hi>Enoch,</hi> a <hi>Noah,</hi> a <hi>Caleb,</hi> a <hi>Joſhua,</hi> a <hi>Job,</hi> a <hi>David,</hi> a <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>Barnabas;</hi> here and there one in their ſeveral ages, that are thorough with God, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal in the duties of godlineſs, heart purity, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſimplicity, univerſal holineſs, converſe with God, meditation on things above, tenderneſs of conſcience, ſelf-denyal, mortifiedneſs to the world, heavenly-mindedneſs, ſpiritual converſes, are commodities that few deal about this day. A thorough-paced Chriſtian is the Phoenix of the place he lives in, and more ſeldom ſeen than a ſparkling Diamond in the dark night we live in; few ſeek theſe goods in earneſt, as they do the world and their own things, and fewer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21. Few I fear do live in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:132285:26"/> daily exerciſe of their graces, the warm breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their ſouls after God and ſpiritual things: few that find the white ſtone, that live in the view of their pardons, and ſenſible enjoyment of divine grace; and therefore theſe heavenly goods are rare things, ſeldome diſcovered, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome known, ſeldome purſued, ſeldome enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and being rare, are excellent and deſirable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Heavenly things are the beſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt coſtly; this argument will not hold in all things: men may buy their deſired comforts too dear, and give more for the world, pleaſures, and their particular goods, than they are worth; but none can be deceived in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes wares; the glory of God, the ſalvation of ſouls, the enjoyment of grace and ſpiritual bleſſings, cannot be too dearly obtained; their price beſpeaks the greatneſs of their worth, they being realities and things excellent in their nature and uſe; and if they are valuable according to their price, they muſt needs be tranſcendent; for the purchaſe of them coſt God dear; he hath been at the expence of eternal counſels of manifold wiſdom, of unknown love, of the gift and blood of his own Son, to procure theſe great things for Believers; and it hath coſt him mighty power and patience to fit Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers for them, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine<note place="margin">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:132285:27"/> Chriſt up the hill, through thick and thin, through ſcorns and thorns, day and night, through every change, in every ſtate, home to the grave: No eaſier terms are given to the enjoyment of theſe riches, than a hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to theſe propoſals, which may expoſe the ſoul to an actual loſs of his earthly all, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing unknown tryals, troubles and duties in the way: This bargain, though bleſſed in it ſelf, yet is thought ſo dear by ſome, as that they break upon theſe very terms, and think God, grace and glory, too chargeable for their acceptance: This then ſets off the worth of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, that they coſt ſo much upon choice, and upon the higheſt reaſon and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As their price is high, ſo is their worth great; they are good in themſelves, and good to thoſe that have them. <hi>Hearken dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently unto me, and eat that which is good, and let your ſouls delight it ſelf in fatneſs;</hi> earthly things are not ſo, if good in themſelves, yet they may not be good to thoſe that have them: Riches are ſnares and ſwords to the owners thereof, and oftentimes do pierce them thorough with many ſorrows: They are not onely good, but abſolutely good; other things are not ſo; earthly things are but conditionally good, when God ſees them good, and makes them good, ſo long as he doth bleſs them, and let out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelf through them, manna, food, rayment, nether ſprings, are ſo far good as God is pleaſed to convey out ſome ſpiritual good thorough them, or make them ſome way ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:132285:27"/> thereto; theſe things cannot make men hapyy, or prove them ſo. <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s greatneſs could not ſecure him from gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing amongſt the beaſts, and bedding with them in open fields, and under wetting dews, <hi>Dan. 4. 33. Belſhazzar</hi>'s pleaſures could not guard him from the hand-writing againſt the wall, <hi>Dan. 5. 5. Dives</hi> was in the midſt of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honour one day and the next in hell. Theſe lower things are but as ciſterns and pipes, that ſignifie nothing, except ſome waters be conveyed through them; no more do theſe, unleſs God let out his love, and promiſe through them. Theſe heavenly things are not onely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely good, but every way good; good for every man, in every ſtate; good for poor and rich, for young and old, for all perſons, all things; <hi>Godlineſs is profitable for every thing, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 8. There is no perſon or condition, but grace and ſpiritual bleſſings are good for, and can convey good thorough: There may be ſuch a caſe in which nothing of this lower world can help: <hi>Riches make them wings and profit not in the day of wrath.</hi> In times of trouble and divine wrath, inſtruments of muſick carry no ſweetneſs in them but ſpiritual mercies, they help to comfort in the day of trouble: <hi>In the multitude of ſad thoughts within me thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts refreſh my ſoul, Pſal.</hi> 94. 19.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Their duration proves them excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, they are laſting wares; time works no change upon theſe, the Heavens will wax old, and as a veſture they ſhall be changed; but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things never periſh with the uſing: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:132285:28"/> our meaſures and ſenſe of theſe may change, we may not always have the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of grace or comfort; but this alteration is not in theſe things, but in us; as God; ſo grace and ſpiritual things, are in themſelves the ſame, yeſterday, to day, and for ever; good in proſperity, and good in adverſity; good in life, and good in death: mutability mars all earthly comforts, they are things of no continuance; we may have them, but cannot hold them; like the fleeting Iſlands about the <hi>Tenariff,</hi> which perſons ſee at a diſtance, but when they come near them, they vaniſh away: <hi>The things that are ſeen are temporal, 2 Cor. 4. 18. We may</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ostenduntur iſtae res non poſſidentur &amp; dum place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant tranſeunt.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>have them,</hi> (faith <hi>Seneca) but cannot poſſeſs them; and they no ſooner pleaſe us, but paſs from us:</hi> but unſeen things are eternal: His love is everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the graces of his Spirit abiding: 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 9. Whoſoever is born of God ſinneth not, for his ſeed remaineth in him:</hi> The joys of the Holy-Ghoſt are laſting: <hi>That my joy might remain in you: Jer. 31. 3. Joh. 15. 11. Iſa. 59. 21. Heb. 10. 34. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 4. Indeed acts of grace may fail for a time, but the habit of grace is never loſt; frames, and ſtreams of comfort may ebb, but the Fountain of Joy is never drain'd dry; Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is immutable, Pardon of Sin is irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the Saints treaſures in Heaven are endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and can never fade away: Men may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live their Treaſures here, and ſee all their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions go before them; but heavenly Intereſts, and immortal Souls, are of like continuance,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:132285:28"/> and this greatens their value: Men eſtimate a little Land beyond a great Eſtate of uncertain continuance; and ſuch are Wiſdom's wares, there's no rotten goods among them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, The heavenly Trade is the beſt Trade, in regard of the Trader theſe Merchants deal with: Much of the comfort, ſafety and advantage of mens Trades, lieth in in the perſons they trade with; if theſe be able, honeſt, affectionate, it conduces much to the thriving of thoſe they deal with: What miſchief comes to Traders, when Sellers are cheating, cruel, and extortioning? and when Buyers are falſe, and deceitful, and fail of their word? But none of theſe hazards can heavenly Traders be expoſed to, from thoſe they deal with: Indeed Wiſdom's Merchants have to do with many, in the purſuit of their heavenly Trade, both by way of taking in, and letting out; but yet there is one great Merchant, with whom they principally deal, as to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and iſſue of their whole Trade, in this Merchandiſe; they converſe with God, Saints and Angels, but all is done through a Mediator; the Goods they receive is upon his intereſt; they deal with God through him; all their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to trade, and rules to act by, come from him; the good and advantage of all their Trading, is ſecur'd by him; and though they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd with many perſons and things, (with all that duty and providence calls them too,) and, with the Chymiſt, are to extract ſome good from every thing they deal with; and, like the Bee, gather Honey from weeds; yet this good
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:132285:29"/> they get from perſons and things, is not in them, but conveyed through them from the great Purchaſer with whom they deal; good from every thing, to theſe heavenly Traders, and Heirs of Salvation is made over in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe; (<hi>All things ſhall work together for good to them that love God, and are called according to his purpoſe,) Rom.</hi> 8. 28. and ſhall in due time, through theſe Conduits, be emptied out to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, by the hand of Jeſus: So that it is properly, and ſtrictly, but with one great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant thoſe Traders have to do with for the goods they lay out, or take in; all other things and perſons are but ways and inſtruments of his appointment, through which it ſhall be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and this makes Wiſdom's Trade ſo good, that the advantage of it is not depending on thoſe ſecondary Agents, they have to do with but upon one, that is more excellent, both great and good, able and faithful to anſwer both his promiſes, and the expectations of thoſe that deal with him. As to his Quality, and perſonal Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, he is above all, and over all, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: <hi>He hath a veſture on his thigh, whereon is written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, Rev.</hi> 19. 16. He is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty on high, the Glory of Heaven and Earth; he hath Angels to worſhip him, Thrones and Principalities under him, all creatures in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth to ſerve him. O! how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable is it to deal with him, to whom Kings and Potentates pay their tribute, and to whom Men and Angels yield their homage? It's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with Men, to converſe with thoſe that are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:132285:29"/> above them, and to manage concerns with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Honour, and Greatneſs: but here's one (Souls) that offers to trade with you, from whom all creatures receive their glory.</p>
            <p>Yea, his Goodneſs anſwers his Greatneſs, and ſweetly tempers his perſonal converſe for the encouragement of the meaneſt Soul, that hath occaſions with him: Greatneſs without Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, rather checks than relieves the hopes of thoſe that are beneath it; but ſuch is the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt's nature, as that his Glory doth but render his Goodneſs the more amiable; and his Goodneſs repreſents his Glory the more deſirable; he values no man by his own worth, nor deſpiſes any for their low eſtate; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Soul hath as eaſy acceſs to him, and as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a reception, as perſons of higheſt repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with men: <hi>I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones, Iſa.</hi> 57. 15. He is of a ſweet and gracious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, of a free and generous ſpirit, good to all, eſpecially to thoſe that ſeek him: this renders perſons deſirable, who would chooſe to deal with men of ugly natures, and churliſh diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions: affability and ſweetneſs do ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite men to converſe with ſuch; and none like to Jeſus for excellent goodneſs and loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for pitty and bounty; goodneſs is his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, mercy his delight; he takes pleaſure in doing good; none that trade with him, but he will ſee them to be the better for it.</p>
            <p>He is alſo able as well as good; Some men
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:132285:30"/> have excellent natures, but ſtraitned capacities, they are willing to do good beyond their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but it is not ſo with the Saints friend; <hi>He hath all power in Heaven and Earth, Mat.</hi> 28. 18. and can do what-ever pleaſeth him; he hath all creatures at his command; all the treaſures of Heaven at his diſpoſe; he is infinitely rich, and hath all that good that Souls can need or deſire; he hath goods of all kinds of ſupply his Cuſtomers with; it is not ſo with men, no Merchant can furniſh his Traders with every thing they need; but one ſells this ware, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that; here men ſail to one Countrey for one Commodity, and to another Countrey for other Wares; they ranſack Nature's treaſures by Sea and Land, borrow ſomething from every Nation, that hath a peculiar excellency, to make up their ſupplies, and furniſh all their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and pleaſures: but the Lord Jeſus hath all that in him, and at his diſpoſe, which you need; he can ſupply all your wants, having all fulneſs dwelling in him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. He hath that in him which your Souls want, and the command of that you need for your Bodies alſo: He can give you the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of your heart, <hi>Pſal. 37. 4. He is able to make all grace abound towards you, that you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, having all-ſufficiency in all things, may abound in every good work, 2 Cor.</hi> 9. 8. Here's no leſs than five Alls, that flow from the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt to Believers; All grace abounding in them, All ſufficiency enjoy'd by them, All ways, in All things, for All good works: Did Souls but believe the all-ſufficiency of Chriſt,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:132285:30"/> they would not ſo perplex their ſpirits when in wants, with, what ſhall I eat? and with what ſhall I be clothed? and how ſhall I get this? and the other mercy I want, when all is offered to Wiſdom's Merchants freely? for godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come; and theſe promiſes are in the hand of Jeſus, for all that come to God by him: <hi>All things are delivered to me of the Father, Matt.</hi> 11. 27. The Lord Jeſus is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to give you all that you ask according to his will, having all things delivered to him for that end; but he can keep it for you, and ſecure it to your uſe: <hi>I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that good thing I have committed to him, againſt that day, 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 12. This all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of Chriſt, is argument enough to new-Covenant-federates, for a calm and quiet dependance on him, and holy walking before him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1.</p>
            <p>And that which is exceeding pleaſing to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders alſo, he is faithful as well as able; he is one of his word, that makes good all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to a tittle, to thoſe that by Faith deal with him: <hi>The holy one of</hi> Iſrael <hi>cannot lie, or alter the word that is gone out of his mouth; hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? hath he ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſhall he not make it good? Numb.</hi> 23. 19. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. He is the faithful witneſs; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is his name. <hi>And he that ſate upon the Throne was called faithful and true, Rev.</hi> 19. 11. And faithfulneſs is his nature, in compariſon of whom every man is a liar: <hi>Let God be true, and every man a liar, Rom.</hi> 3. 4. If the Lord Jeſus were
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:132285:31"/> not faithfull to his word and undertaking, the Father would not have truſted him with all the concerns of his glory and people in the world; neither had he been a fit perſon for the Elect to have committed unto him their ſouls, and all that is dear to them: Men promiſe one thing and do another; affirm a thing that is not, and this undoes many, the unfaithfulneſs of thoſe they deal with; but it is not ſo with Chriſt, you may truſt on his fidelity; Heaven and Earth ſhall ſooner fail, than one tittle of all that he hath ſpoken: And therefore excellent is that Trade which is carried on with ſo excellent a Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Weigh the terms on which this Trade is offered unto ſouls, and it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be incomparably the beſt Trade. For to ſuch as will ſet upon this Trade,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 <hi>Goods to trade upon ſhall be freely given.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2 <hi>Wiſdome to manage them ſhall be fully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3 <hi>A bleſſing on the due improvement of them ſhall be enſured.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4 <hi>To him ſhall the glory of all be rendred.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, Wiſdome's wares are freely tendered to all that will receive them, without money, and without price: <hi>Come buy wine and milk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money and without price, Iſa. 55. 1. To him that is a thirſt will I give to drink of the waters of life freely, Rev.</hi> 21. 6. Here Merchants cannot get or put off goods at that rate; there's no going to the world's markets without money or credit; they that will have mens goods muſt pay for them, and many times have deat bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:132285:31"/> but the Lord Jeſus imparts his treaſures freely, he paid dear for them, they coſt his heart blood, but he ſpares them freely; no ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or gold will paſs in thoſe bargains. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had his offered gold, for the Holy Ghoſt, thrown back with deteſtation and deſtruction to boot, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 18, 19, 20. The terms on which this trade is driven are free; it cannot ſtand with the deſign of redemption grace, which is to advance the praiſe of the glory of grace, and to cut off all boaſting, that every mouth may be ſtopped; to admit of any thing from fallen man that might look like a compenſation of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mercies; neither is there any thing beneath Chriſt's merits, that can equalize the worth of heavenly things; and alas what have they to part with who have loſt themſelves? and to give to God, who have nothing but what they receive from him? It muſt needs therefore be altogether freely given, whatever is received in order to ſalvation: O bleſſed news to poor traders, that their poverty is no bar to this employment; the pooreſt may receive of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome's wares, as well as the rich, ſeeing it is a free trade; and whatever makes a difference on the creatures part, is laid aſide in the diſpenſation of ſpiritual mercies: Here are no Monopolies, or hard impoſitions upon this trade; no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint from ſetting up, or ſelling out of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome's goods, in any parts of the world. Cities have their encloſures, Corporations their bars to keep out ſtrangers from their priviledges; but in this trade all perſons, be they who they will that will come over to Wiſdome's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:132285:32"/> have right to carry on this work of godlineſs in all places whereever they are. The heavenly trade is a free trade, goods freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and liberty to ſet up in all places, and to all perſons.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As goods to trade upon are freely given; ſo wiſdome to manage them ſhall be fully imparted: This is a priviledge which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers on earth will not afford; you may have their goods at their price, but not inſtructions how to diſpoſe them to your advantage; but this great Merchant in Heaven, with his wares, gives skill to uſe them: <hi>I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way thou ſhouldeſt go, Iſa. 48. 17. If thou ſeekeſt her as ſilver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid treaſure, then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God: For the Lord giveth wiſdome, out of his mouth cometh knowledge and underſtanding: He layeth up ſound wiſdome for the righteous. Then ſhalt thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand righteouſneſs, and judgement, and equity; yea every good path, Prov.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6, 9. The ſoul that ſeeketh for Wiſdome's wares, ſhall with it find inſtruction how to uſe them: <hi>I will inſtruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou ſhouldeſt go; I will guide thee with my eyes, Pſal.</hi> 32. 8. He will be <hi>eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, Job</hi> 29. 15. The Lord Jeſus will find all in this heavenly trade, goods, and tools, and skill, and ſtrength, and all: <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, A bleſſing on the due improvement of theſe ſhall be enſured to all his traders: <hi>The
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:132285:32"/> wayfaring man ſhall not erre, Iſa.</hi> 35. 8. His workmen ſhall not labour in vain, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 58. For his bleſſing is upon his people, Pſal. 3. 8. Thou ſhalt decree a thing, and it ſhall be eſtabliſhed unto thee, and the light ſhall ſhine upon thy waies, Job 22. 28. The book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayeſt obſerve to do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all that is written therein,</hi> (this is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly trade, to fulfill after God, and ſuch ſhall proſper,) <hi>for then thou ſhalt make thy way proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous, and then thou ſhalt have good ſucceſs, Joſh.</hi> 1. 8. No Merchant will undertake to make their dealers proſperous; they muſt trade at great uncertainties, and run the adventure as to the iſſue of all: Bleſſings come not out of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhops, but from a divine hand, let come what will in the way: Bleſſings will ſurely come at the end to thoſe that caſt out at Chriſt's bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and trade by his inſtruction in Wiſdome's Merchandiſe, let men curſe, let devils vex, let North-winds blow, and blow down too their earthly comforts, <hi>yet God will bleſs them that fear him, every one, Pſal.</hi> 115. 13. He will bleſs them in life, and bleſs them in death; and is not this good trading, to be ſure of bleſſings in the way, and bleſſedneſs at the end? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another Condition in this Trade is, That God ſhall have all the glory, but they that trade with and for him ſhall have all the good that comes by it: This is the head Rent which the great Lord reſerves to himſelf, and will not part with to another: <hi>My glory will I not give to another, Iſa.</hi> 48. 11. This is his great
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:132285:33"/> deſign in all works of his hands, and gifts of grace, that he may be glorified: <hi>The people ſhall be all righteous, the branch of my planting, the work of my hand, that I may be glorified.</hi> This is God's great end in beſtowing redemption mercies, to have all the glory to himſelf, <hi>who worketh all things after the counſel of his own will, that we ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 12. Chriſtians, the Rent muſt be the Lords, the fruit ſhall be yours: <hi>Whoſe keepeth the fig-tree ſhall eat the fruit thereof, Prov.</hi> 27. 18. All the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Vine is for thoſe that poſſeſs it, and the herbs of the earth for them by whom it is dreſſed, <hi>Judg. 9. 13. Heb. 6. 7. The righteous ſhall eat the fruit of his doings, Iſa.</hi> 3. 10. The preſent comforts of holineſs are not mean; <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law, and nothing ſhall offend them, Pſal. 119. 165. Her waies are waies of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi> Religion is the moſt pleaſant trade; no delights like thoſe that are in God, and fetch'd from him: God gives the world the bones, and keeps the marrow for his labourers; the godly feed on the wheat, the wicked have but the bran; look whatever good, comfort, credit and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs Religion can afford here, and to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is their part that trade upon it: <hi>Who plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Vineyard, and eateth not the fruit thereof, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Laſtly, The Heavenly Trade muſt needs be the beſt trade, becauſe it is the moſt profitable trade: The advantage that comes by godlineſs, makes it the beſt employment in the world. We uſe to ſay, three things make tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:132285:33"/> rich, all which are found in the way of godlineſs.</p>

            <p>Firſt, Great returns will ſoon make traders rich, when the time and labour they expend is abundantly compenſated, and the things they part with, bring in far better: ſo is it with this heavenly trade; there is no proportion in their adventures to their returns: their duties are poor imperfect things; when they have done all, they are unprofitable ſervants, but their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is great and glorious; their afflictions light and momentary, but the iſſue, a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. It's great profit indeed, when ſome weak works of faith, and labours of love, a little patience, obedience and duty for a time, ſhall be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with eternal reſt, pleaſure and glory: there is no equality between the race and price, this ſtriving and crowning: What's a cup of cold water, to a river of pleaſures? a Crown of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:132285:34"/> thorns, to a Crown of Glory? the worlds ſrowns, to divine ſmiles? conſcience-troubles, to the conſolations of God? a few tears, fears, watchings, faintings, duties, afflictions, to the joys of the Lord into which they ſhall for ever enter?</p>
            <p>It's a great bargain to part with baſe things, for excellent; beaſtly luſts, for the beauties of holineſs; an unclean, for a clean heart; vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, for vertuous diſpoſitions; filthy rags, for fair garments; a body of death, for a ſpirit of life. To let go the world for God, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with devils, for communion with Chriſt, to loſe guilt, and to gain righteouſneſs; to eſcape Hell, to obtain Heaven; this is great gain. To ſwap away old things, for new; rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten things, for ſound; hypocriſie, for ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; lyes, for truth, is a good bargain. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change empty things, for ſatisfying; things that are not, for things that are; goods that periſh with the uſing, for things that wax not old; fading trifles, for eternal treaſures, is a thriving trade indeed; and ſuch are the incomes of this Heavenly Trade, they are incomparably great and excellent; there's nothing mean, no low price goods, that Wiſdome's Merchants deal about; all their riches are pleaſant and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: <hi>By knowledge ſhall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleaſant riches;</hi> precious faith, precious promiſes, the precious blood of Chriſt, precious thoughts of God, are ſome of this precious ſubſtance heavenly Traders meet with in the way of holineſs. Beſides, this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of godlineſs enters ſouls into an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and converſe with God, and helps them
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:132285:34"/> to keep an entercourſe with Heaven, and to maintain a life above and beyond the reach of all others; and is not this advantage?</p>
            <p>Religion alſo helps men to bleſſed experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the love, power, greatneſs and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; and this conſtant employment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout heavenly things, makes the way pleaſant and delightful, and fills the ſoul with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment with its lot in the world, whatever the tryals, loſſes and ſufferings may be that they are expoſed to. Alſo the driving this Heavenly Trade ſecures the good and comfort of all their other intereſts, and ſweetens their portion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or leſs that Soverign pleaſure allots them in the world, bringing all their concerns under divine care and promiſe for their good, comfort and ſufficient ſupply in their paſſage home: And are not all theſe great returns? enough to make the Heavenly Trade the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intereſt and advantage beyond all others in the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sure returns make Traders rich: Merchants that drive gainful trades, count if one Adventure to two or three come ſafely home, they get well: but all regular Adventures in this Heavenly Trade are ſecured; <hi>Their labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 58. not one of their ſincere attempts in the way of God ſhall miſcarry; never a pious duty loſt; all their ſowings to the ſpirit ſhall ſurely ſpring up into a bleſſed harveſt, <hi>Gal. 6. 6. Though they ſow in tears, yet they ſhall reap in joy Pſal.</hi> 126. 5, 6. Though they go forth weeping, yet if they bear precious ſeed, they ſhall doubtleſs come
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:132285:35"/> again with rejoycing, bringing their ſheaves with them: <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget their work and labour of love ſhewn towards his Name, Heb.</hi> 6. 10. God is engaged in juſtice to ſee the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of Believers ſafely returned into their harbour; he hath promiſed it, and cannot be unfaithful; neither doth it conſiſt with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to put Believers on an unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: <hi>He never ſaid to the houſe of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain, Iſa.</hi> 45. 19. Ingenuous men love to ſee their ſervants thrive: Will Chriſt, think you, let his labourers be loſers? their works ſhall ſurely follow them into their reſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. how ever they may be out of ſight in their paſſage towards it, ſeeing God's Word lies at ſtake for it.</p>
            <p>The blood of Chriſt ſtands engaged alſo for the ſafe returns of the Saints Adventures, that are according to the will of God; their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labours are part of the travel of his ſoul, which he muſt ſee ſecured, and they are the pleaſure of the Lord, which muſt proſper in his hand, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10, 11. He is become a Surety for them unto God, and a Surety for the Father unto them: <hi>By ſo much was Jeſus made a Surety of a better teſtament, Heb.</hi> 7. 22. The Covenant is called here a Teſtament, as relating to the Saints priviledges and intereſts, which by that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant becomes due to them, and ſhall be ſurely made good to them upon the account of Chriſt's Suretiſhip for it; He is the Surety of this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament or Covenant, and every promiſe of it; one of which is, That what they ſow to the Spirit, they ſhall reap in glory; their labour
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:132285:35"/> ſhall not be in vain: and to make all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes good both the condition and bleſſing to the foederates of this new-Covenant, hath the Lord Jeſus laid down his precious Blood, which cannot be loſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15. but it would be caſt away, could Believers religious duties be in vain.</p>
            <p>Another thing that ſecures the Saints advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages by this heavenly Trade, is this; that their trading is the work and product of his own Spirit; their duties are his work: <hi>Thou haſt wrought all our works in us, Iſa. 26. 22. It is God that worketh in you to will and to do, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his good pleaſure, Phil. 2. 13. Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God, 2 Col. 3. 5. They are his workmanſhip, created to good works, Eph.</hi> 2. 10. by whoſe influence they are acted, and let by the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. So that further than the ſpirit of the living creatures move, their wheels cannot move, nor do any thing graciouſly, further than their works are wrought of God, and by God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 21. So that Believers labours in this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Trade, are the work of the eternal Spirit; and ſhould their work be loſt, the Spirit of God would labour in vain, and his work caſt away; which cannot be, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 18.</p>
            <p>Laſtly The Lord Jeſus is an adventurer with them, his Glory and Kingdom is concern'd in this heavenly Trade; when his Will is done, his Kingdom is come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 10. and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 3. Holineſs is his will, and a conformity to his Law, and he is engag'd to the Father, for the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:132285:36"/> Saints holineſs and happineſs; for their grace and glory; <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as thou haſt given him, Jo.</hi> 17. 2, 12. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath put all Believers into the hands of Chriſt, and intruſted him with their graces and glory, both which are included in eternal life: <hi>ver. 3. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, &amp;c.</hi> that is, this is the way to life eternal, and the beginning of life eternal, even the grace of Faith, and ſaving knowledg of God: and this grace, as well as glory, is put into the hand of Chriſt for Believers, to be kept for them; and they are alſo put into his hand, to be kept by him through it unto glory: and in purſuance of this truſt, the Lord Jeſus is engaged, to keep his people, their graces, and the reward of them, for them, that they be not loſt; the advantages of this heavenly Trade, are ſecured to Believers by the Lord Jeſus, his adventure with them, his truth, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and glory, is concern'd in their ſafety: ſo that their returns are not only great, but ſure.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Quick returns, if great, are greatly enriching: Hence comes that Proverb, that light gain makes a heavy purſe, it brings great cuſtom, and that occaſions quick returns: Now, no Trade brings quicker returns than the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Trade: <hi>Behold I come quickly, and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is with me, Rev.</hi> 22. 12. The Lord Jeſus not only makes good, but quick payment; as ſoon as the work is done, he promiſeth to make good his word: <hi>Call upon me in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and I will deliver thee, Pſal.</hi> 50. 15. Nay,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:132285:36"/> the Lord Jeſus ſometimes pays before-hand: <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that before they call, I will anſwer; and whiles they are ſpeaking, I will hear, Iſ.</hi> 65. 24. Men many times are forc'd to ſtay for their Mony and ſometimes loſe it at laſt; but the Believers gain is not only ſure, but ſpeedy.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> What's the reaſon then, the people of God do complain of God's not hearing, and deferring an anſwer to their requeſts? And why are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers adviſed to patience, and long-ſaffering, after they have done the will of God, if the return of their Faith and Duties were ſo quick? This is the experience, and complaint of the people of God in all ages, that God ſeems not to regard their Prayers, and to delay his coming to help them.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Firſt, yet are the Saints returns quick; becauſe they are in due time; God never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays to perform his word, when the Believer hath need of it; in the needful time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he will ſurely hear; <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your wants, Phil.</hi> 4. 19. When once the Soul comes to ſtand in real want, then God will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pay him; <hi>When the poor and needy ſeek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirſt, I the Lord will hear them, Iſa.</hi> 40. 17. When once they come to be needy, then God will with-hold no longer, but will help; this he hath promiſed, <hi>they ſhall not want any good thing, Pſal.</hi> 34. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the Lord do not pay preſently, he will give uſe for it, they ſhall loſe nothing by forbearance; <hi>But when he comes, he will bring
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:132285:37"/> his reward with him, Iſa.</hi> 40. 10. Not only a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his work done by them, but a reward of their patient waiting for his promiſes alſo, their mercy ſhall be ſo much the ſweeter, for their want of it, and waiting for it. O! how welcome are long look'd for mercies, when they come, then is every mercy double; God tried <hi>Job</hi> long by with-holding mercy, but ſee the end of <hi>Job;</hi> God paid double for what he took, and with-held from him, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 10. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns are ſure always in the needful and ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time; and if God delays, he will pay well for it.</p>
            <p>To which I might add this alſo; Many times Wiſdom's Merchants are the cauſe of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, by their unfaithfulneſs in their trade, or their unfitneſs for their returns: <hi>The diligent hand makes rich, Prov.</hi> 10. 4. Souls that are active and faithful in the whole of Religion, ſhall have no cauſe to complain of God's ſlack payment.</p>
            <p>So much by way of demonſtration of the point, That the Heavenly Trade is the beſt Trade; no Merchandiſe like Wiſdom's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, to come to ſome improvement of the Point.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, If the heavenly Trade be the beſt Trade, then it's ſtrange that ſo few do ſet upon this Trade; perſons that are to enter upon ſome courſe of life, and would fain live in the World,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:132285:37"/> are willing to take the beſt Trade that is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by them, if they can but reach it, and have wherewithal to carry it on: who would ſpend his time and ſtrength in low, ſordid and mechanick ſervices, which cannot maintain, or enrich him; if a brave, generous and wealthy Calling did offer it ſelf, and might be compaſſed? and yet ſuch is the folly of moſt under the Goſpel, who are ready to chooſe any thing but Godlineſs, and to fall in with every propoſal for their employment, rather than to engage about the work of Salvation: Men are wiſe in their generation, and know in other things how to chooſe the beſt bargains, only in the things of their Souls are fooliſh, and can be content to purſue ſhadows, and let go the ſubſtance; to lay out all their deſires, hopes and labours about a life that periſheth, neglecting the vaſt concerns of another World, and the welfare of their immortals Souls: Is not this folly? Poor Sinners, let me reaſon a little with you, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to recover your loſt underſtanding: come, be your own judges; Is it your intereſt (think you) to adventure your All, for things that cannot abide with you when obtained, nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy you if they ſtay? things that can but bring you to your Grave, and accompany your bodies to the Houſe of Mourhing, and there leave you; unleſs they ſhew you the way to Hell alſo. Is it not madneſs to adventure your Souls for a trade, pleaſures and treaſures of ſo ſhort continuance, and little advantage? things that you will ſhortly be as weary of, as now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous; and throw them to the Bats and Moles
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:132285:38"/> of the Earth, that you may go into the Rocks to hide you from the fury of a Sin-avenging God? Will you ſpend all upon time, and lay up nothing for eternity? Or, is it rational to think that you ſhould reap where you never ſowed, and poſſeſs the benefit of that Trade you never drove? <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8. Can you think to reach Heaven hereafter, and never walk one foot in the way to it here? Certainly, what men ſow, that they ſhall reap: Can you imagine the things of Heaven to be ſo cheap, as to be had without looking after? Alas, things far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour cannot be ſo eaſily obtained; it may coſt ſome of you many tuggings, much ſweat, labour and expence to get but a little of this World; and do you think to find this tried Gold without buying, and digging for it? and is it a wiſe bargain (think you) to purchaſe your deſirable Comforts with the loſs of your Souls? and that you may gain but a little of the World, to part with a poſſibility of having Heaven? <hi>What will it profit you to get the World,</hi> (were you ſure of every part of it) <hi>and to loſe your Souls? Mat.</hi> 16. 26. And what if you miſs of your hopes in this, and fall ſhort of Heaven too? never have what you look'd for on Earth, nor a place in Heaven neither; will not your caſe be then dreadful? O! fooliſh Souls! that may be happy, but will not; that may get into ſuch a courſe of life as would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich you here, and for ever; but refuſe it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring a poor beggarly life before a rich and noble ſtate; chooſing rather to trade with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils than God; to ſwap away your delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:132285:38"/> time, for doleful eternity; your ſalvation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, ſwiniſh pleaſures. O ſad exchange for! to be bewailed, but not remedied: What? to barter away ſtrength for weakneſs; deſires for emptineſs; labours for vanity; hope for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; precious ſouls for periſhing ſhadows; an open door of grace for a ſhut door of glory; mercy for miſery; earth for hell? O fools in grain! to let go ſuch a bargain, as being had, would for ever make you; and being loſt, may never be regained; but in the room of it, an eternity to repent your time of folly; when tears and cries will be too late, when mercy ſhall have no repentings for you, bowels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no roulings over you, nor everlaſting arms any help for you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 10. This is your danger, (Sinners,) this may be your caſe, who refuſe wiſdom's counſels, chooſing death rather than life: you that would have none of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's wares, nor work; but have rather va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued the Devil's Counters, before Chriſt's Gold; and the pleaſures of ſin, that are but for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, before the treaſures of grace and glory, that are eternal; walking after the fleſh, and ſerving divers luſts, till your trading time for Heaven be almoſt over. Alas, Sinners, there may be, for any thing you know, but few Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſing hours left for you in this World; it may be ſcarce a Sabbath more between ſome of you, and hell: in what a caſe then are you like to be, who never ſet upon this heavenly Trade to this very day? and ſhould you now go out of this World ſtrangers to this employment, in what a doleful ſtate will your Souls be for ever?
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:132285:39"/> when you come to poſſeſs the eternal fruit of your bad bargain, then could any lay their ears to Hell gates, and liſten at your cries, they would hear ſuch language as this from your trembling lips, <hi>Folly, Folly, Woe, Woe, Eternity, Eternity.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, This calls to mourning over the great decaies of this Heavenly Trade, in the times and places wherein we live: Loſs of Trade is eaſily reſented as an evil caſe, a matter of trouble. Men uſe to be affected with hard times, when a death lies on their intereſts, and their earthly concerns are at a loſs; and this is the caſe of moſt men this day; all places are full of complaints about their affairs in the world; there's a moth in mens labours and dealings, and it is eaſily ſeen and felt; the heavy looks, and heartleſs carriages of many, do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtrate a ſenſe of their temporal waſtes, and their mouths vent ſuch-language: <hi>The times are hard, and the trade of the Nation gone:</hi> But alas! where are the mourners of <hi>Sion?</hi> and who is afflicted at the decaies of godlineſs, and death on this Heavenly Trade? Though there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more viſible and lamentable than the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back in Religion; yet who laies it to heart? and who is rightly affected with this important evil?</p>
               <p>Now towards the cure of this inſenſibleneſs, and to awaken our hearts to a due apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of our evil caſe, by reaſon of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caies of godlineſs; I ſhall</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:132285:39"/>
               <list>
                  <item>1 <hi>Lay down ſome ſymptomes evidencing it to be our caſe, that there are real and great decaies of this Heavenly Trade in the time and places wherein we live.</hi>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, That this Heavenly Trade goes back and decaies, is ſo evident, that he is a ſtranger in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and hath too much of a ſpirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd in theſe matters, who doth not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee Religion, and the power of Godlineſs dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and languiſhing in moſt places and perſons. Now the better to evince this ſad truth, I ſhall proceed in a plain and familiar method, keeping to the metaphor in the text, and the uſual ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of decay'd Trading.</p>
               <p>Six things uſually ſhew the decaies of earthly Trading, all which are concluſive of the point in hand, and diſcover bad times for piety, and great waſtes of Religion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When the price of things is much fal'n, and the rates very low, and goods are worth little or nothing; then men ſay, it's bad trading: So is it now in this Heavenly Trade; the rate and value of divine things is much abated; Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's goods ſeem little worth to many: There was a time when Heavenly Wares were highly prized; the Word of God was precious to ſouls, far better to Saints than thouſands of gold and ſilver; they could have parted with all the world, to enjoy God in Ordinances: eſtate, eaſe, credit, were nothing to a place in God's houſe; and one view of his countenance was better than life: Oh how ſweet were the words of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:132285:40"/> his mouth? much ſweeter than the honey and honey-comb: Men could let their own ploughs ſtand ſtill, to ſet their hands to God's plough; with <hi>Mary,</hi> they could neglect any buſineſs to ſit at Chriſt's feet, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 39. leave their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed food, and moſt pleaſant delicacies, for one draught of Sanctuary-waters; yea but for one ſip of divine ſweetneſs, they could break their reſt, leave all for Chriſt's company; bear frowns, threatenings, loſſes, ſufferings, with wonderful eaſe, for ſome fellowſhip with God and his people; they would not loſe a praying or hearing hour, whatever it coſt them; they would ſtick at no hardſhips; price ſhould never break between Chriſt and them; ſubſcribe any terms, and count it a cheap bargain too, if at any rate they might obtain grace, and ſome ſpiritual good to their ſouls. But alas! now the caſe is altered; few will bid much for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things of <hi>Sion;</hi> even they that could have plucked out their eyes, and have given them to the Meſſengers of Chriſt, now think it too dear to pluck their hands out of their boſomes to open the door to Chriſt himſelf: Now ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledges are worth little or nothing; Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, ſociety of Saints are ſcarce counted worth the parting with a little time, eaſe, buſineſs, or friend, to enjoy them. <hi>A ſhop, a market,</hi> is better than the ſolemn Meeting with moſt: few can ſtep over a ſtraw, and forbear to gather a little ſtubble, though it be to get the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able treaſure of Chriſt: This is the ſad temper of moſt Profeſſours this day, they have loſt their eſtimation of Chriſt and ſpiritual things;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:132285:40"/> they do not value (let men talk what they will) God, above the world; Chriſt, above reſt; one day in his Courts, above a thouſand elſewhere; his precious Word, above their appointed food: moſt think it more adviſeable to take ſeaſons for the world, than for Heaven; rather to baulk many Sermons, than loſe a little profit and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, though but of very ſmall advantage in the world: Men are full, and rich, and have goods enough; they think they know enough already; have heard enough, prayed enough; they feel no want of, nor ſee worth in ſpiritual things; and therefore offer ſo little for ſoul-advantages; and this beſpeaks manifeſtly the decay of this Heavenly Trade.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Fewneſs of buyers argues bad trading: Among men, when Chapmen are ſcarce, few take off any goods; wares lie on mens hands, and will not off; then men ſay, Trade is fal'n: Thus it is in this Heavenly Trade; there are few buyers of Wiſdom's Wares; choice goods lie on ſellers hands, and will not off; may not the Lord Jeſus complain as formerly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom did, <hi>Prov. 1. 24. I have called, and ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; I have ſtretched out my hands, and no man regarded; you have ſet at nought all my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and would have none of my reproof.</hi> And as the Servants of God in the parable, <hi>Mat. 11. 17. We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned, and ye have not lamented.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets are full in many places; the Lord Jeſus hath much goods expoſed to ſale, and there are many Chapmen, but few buyers; perſons come to Religious Aſſemblies and Sermons, as many
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:132285:41"/> do to Fairs, to ſee, and be ſeen; to gaze on goods, but not to buy; few will take Chriſt's wares on his own terms, and come up to the ſelling-price; God, grace and glory, are too dear for many mens money; they like ſome goods, but the price is too high; ſome could be content to have Chriſt; but to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, take up their Croſs, leave all, and follow Chriſt; that they think is too dear, and break for price, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. Heaven is deſirable at laſt, but the world at preſent; they could be content to take Heaven in reverſion, when the leaſe of their worldly intereſts is expired; and to receive their portion there, when all is gone here; but to trade above now, and tranſport their earthly treaſures to Heaven, while they enjoy them on earth, that's too hard for them; ſuch goods, ſuch overtures will not off; perſons will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Word of God as the Word of God; they will not take threatnings to fear them, warnings to regard them, promiſes to believe them, precepts to obey them. May not moſt Miniſters complain, <hi>Who hath believed our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? and to whom is the arm of the Lord reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Iſa.</hi> 53. 1. Moſt like and commend ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, but few receive and obey them; it's la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable to conſider how little of a Sermon is carried away, remembred and practiſed: This is the ſin of Profeſſours, and ſome that paſs for more than ordinary, and yet are guilty of this careleſs, forgetful and unprofitable hearing; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons entertain truths, as they do their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; when they meet them on the way, ſhake hands and embrace them; be exceeding glad to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:132285:41"/> ſee them, and then bid them farewel; that's the reaſon the Lord Jeſus carries back ſo much goods from Markets; his wares will not off; men buy not: And hence it is alſo that Chriſt turns back their duties; he will not receive the goods of ſuch neither, and this makes bad trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Want of employment is a ſign of bad trading: When Trade is good, every man's hand is full of work; but when men are out of employment, and have nothing to ſet their hand to, but ſtand idle in the Market-place, this ſhews a decay of Trade: And is it not ſo with Wiſdom's Labourers now? Perſons profeſſing God were once active in Religion, but are now grown ſlothful in ſpiritual buſineſs. Where are the works of faith, the labours of love, the fruits of the ſpirit among Chriſtians this day? who is fervent in ſpirit? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 18. who ſtrives in prayer, watching thereunto with all perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. where are they that labour even unto wearineſs for the bread that endures? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. running even unto fainting in the race that is ſet before them? <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 15. Serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God day and night in his Temple, and being diligent that they may be found of him in peace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 14. What <hi>Pharaoh</hi> charged on the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when attempting liberty to ſerve God, may be with much more juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on thoſe that profeſs to ſerve God; and though they may, yet do not: <hi>Ye are Idle, ye are Idle:</hi> and hence it is mens hearts go a whoring after the world, and the fleſh, with the luſts thereof; it is becauſe they are ſlothful in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:132285:42"/> ſpirit; a death is upon their hearts, and this cauſeth the work of God to ceaſe, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. 11. It is but little work moſt do for God this day; how cold, dead, formal, ſlighty, are many in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doing the work of God deceitfully, their own conſciences being Judges? <hi>Jer.</hi> 48. 10. few labour with their hearts before they come to hear, in hearing, and after hearing, to get ſome ſoul-good by it: Men are uſually pleaſed with a Lamp, though there be no oyl in it; cannot be contented without ſome duty, but well pleaſed with bare duty: To be nothing in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion troubles them; but to be ſomething, though never ſo little, ſatisfieth them: and if this be Popery to reſt in the work done, how many Papiſts have we amongſt us this day? Certainly Profeſſors are generally aſleep, or ſlumbering; they do their work ſo badly and heartleſly, their work falls out of their hand, as things do from men aſleep; active for the world, as if they could never do enough; but ſoon tyr'd in the work of God; diſpatch but little of heavenly work from day to day, from one Sabbath to another; little heart-ſearching, ſoul-watching work is done; little in-door em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment is carried on; the exerciſe of faith, hope, humility, patience, zeal, ſelf-denial, ſeems a ſtranger to a great many this day; not for want of occaſions or encouragements to work, (the Lord is ſtill calling upon his Labourers to make haſte) but for want of hearts to work: And this ſpiritual ſloth proves that the Heavenly Trade is much loſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The poverty of Traders plainly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:132285:42"/> ſhews Trading is not good; when a Trade doth not maintain the Trader, but he ſtill goes back, and becomes poorer, then ſurely trading is not good: <hi>The diligent hand makes rich, Prov.</hi> 10. 4. When trading is good Traders uſually thrive, and live well upon it, but when they waſte and become poor, then trading decaies: So is it with Heavenly Traders, when they drive a good Trade for Heaven they grow rich apace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and in their own ſouls: Wiſdom's wares are ſoul-enriching wares: <hi>My fruit is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than gold, yea than fine gold, and my revenue than choice ſilver, Prov.</hi> 8. 19. Men account thoſe to be rich who have much of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but Wiſdom's fruit is better than gold, and therefore muſt needs be enriching: they that have this gold cannot be poor: Hence it is Chriſt counſels <hi>Laodicea</hi> to buy of him gold tryed in the fire, that ſhe might be rich, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1. But alas how poor in ſpirituals are perſons generally this day! <hi>Therefore I ſaid, Sur ly theſe are poor, they are fooliſh, for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgement of their God, Jer.</hi> 5. 4. Unacquaintedneſs with the way of God, when men walk wide from Religion, and loſe their ſtrict and cloſe walking with God, they ſoon become poor and fooliſh: And this is the caſe of many every where; they give a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal liberty to themſelves, and indulge a freedom to walk after the fight of their own eyes, and not by rule; and where this is, there is ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverty, which is too viſible in moſt this day. Chriſtians, do but obſerve your own hearts and others, and you will find this ſpiritual poverty
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:132285:43"/> abounding every where. Little thrivings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear under the beſt of means, choiceſt Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges do little more than keep up a name to live; they convey but little quickenings to the ſoul: A ſhew of Religion, and a meer skeleton of profeſſion, is the common fruit of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in moſt places, whereas all the while decaies are on the vitals of Chriſtianity; abatements in grace appear every day, and a viſible alteration in the whole frame, and internal vigour of the ſoul, faith, love, humility, patience, ſelf-denyal, and every grace becomes weaker every day; <hi>Former daies were better than now, Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 10. Speak Chriſtian, are not matters worſe with thy ſoul, than they were? and abatements appear in every part.</p>
               <p>There was a time when thy mind was beam'd over with Divine Light; the Candle of the Lord did ſhine in thy tabernacle: Thy eye was quick to diſcern good and evil; thou couldeſt once ſee an excellency in the knowledge of Chriſt; O how choice were ſermons! privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges were to thee the uncasking of Jewels, and the opening of hidden glory; thou did'ſt dwell in the Land of Viſions, and ſtill ſome new diſcoveries of light and grace did meet thee in thy affectionate attendance upon God. But now it is not ſo; thy Candle burns dimly, and thy right eye is darkened; now thou ſeeſt but little beauty in grace, or deſireableneſs in truth: things under thy feet th'other day, that ſeem'd nothing compar'd with Chriſt; now through the multiplying-glaſs of thy deceived mind, ſeem great and lovely.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:132285:43"/>
               <p>Formerly thy affections were warm and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after God, his word and ways: O! how precious were his appointed Feaſts, and his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles amiable? thou couldſt delight in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to God, and talk of a bleſſedneſs in his preſence. O the pleaſure, ſweetneſs and joy thy heart did find in thy Cloſet, in ſpiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes, and Duties, and publick Ordinances! thou couldſt weep over ſin, and bedew thy prayers with tears, and find thy heart burn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee while Chriſt was ſpeaking, and melted under the warm beams of divine love. But, alas, now it is not ſo; now thy affections are dead, thy heart as cold as a ſtone; all the while thou art ſpeaking to God in Prayer, or God ſpeaking to thee in his Word, thou findeſt no more ſavour in Ordinances, Duties, and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Converſes, than in the white of an Egg, <hi>Job.</hi> 6. 16. Thou findeſt not that delight in God as formerly, and the night of thy pleaſure is turned to fear unto thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21. 4. This is Soul-poverty.</p>
               <p>Again, there was a time alſo, when thy Will, like the great Wheel in the Clock, could move regularly after God; thou couldſt chooſe God for thy chiefeſt intereſt, and Chriſt for thy only treaſure; preferring an intereſt in him above ten thouſand Worlds: thou couldſt have voted for communion with God, before thy meat and drink; and one hours fellowſhip with Chriſt, beyond all the delights on Earth: thou couldſt chooſe the things that pleaſe God, and deny thy own pleaſure to give content to him: thou couldſt once ſtick to thy firſt choice, and find
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:132285:44"/> the purpoſe of thy heart cleaving to God, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 23. Thou couldſt once reſolve, and keep thy reſolutions; 'twas eaſier to take thy heart out of thy body, than to gain thy conſent to part with Chriſt, his preſence and ways. But now thy will is hardly drawn after pure and conſtant enjoyments of God in his ways: O! how difficult a thing is it to perſwade thy will to let go all for Chriſt, to leave every thing to attend on God, to part with the world and ſelf to wait on God, to throw all over-board to take in Chriſt! How hard is it now, to conſent that Chriſt ſhall have all the command of thy Soul, and diſpoſe of thy deareſt intereſts! now thou findeſt it a work above thee, to keep thy heart in order one hour, or to perform the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of thy Soul to God and Godlineſs; thou reſolveſt, and changeſt every day; thou voweſt, and breakeſt thy vows continually; there is no ſtedfaſtneſs in thy ſpirit: this alſo beſpeaks thy Soul-poverty.</p>
               <p>There was a time alſo when thy Conſcience was tender, thy heart could ſmite thee for the leaſt ſin; thy Conſcience could hold thee to the greateſt duty, and bind thee to thy good behaviour: thou could'ſt not go againſt the light and checks of thy regulated Conſcience, were it to gain the whole World. But now 'tis dead and quiet, it can bear the ſharpeſt ſtrokes of the two edged Sword, and not feel it, or bleed; it makes little or no bones of ſin againſt knowledg, and mercy; ſins that were before troubleſome, now go down eaſily; it can digeſt threatnings and terrors with little
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:132285:44"/> trouble, and ſleep while the arrows of the Lord's wrath flie about its ears; it can let go mercies without regarding, and truths to paſs away without entertainment: this is Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverty.</p>
               <p>This thou can'ſt ſay too, there was formerly an activity in thy Soul for God, and the ſpring of thy heart was ſtrong, and it ſet every wheel a going: thou couldſt run, and not be weary; walk, and not be faint: no religious duty was tireſome to thee; no commands of God were grievous, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 3. no journeys ſeem'd long that led to God, nor Sermons tedious that ſpake of God: thy ſpirit was all life, when in holy company, and work: did any ſay, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the houſe of the Lord, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8. 21. thou wouldſt ſay, I will go alſo: If God did but ſay, Seek thou my face, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 8. thy heart would preſently anſwer, thy face, Lord, will I ſeek. But now a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeizeth upon thee, and ſlothfulneſs gathers in over thy whole Soul: thou art ſoon weary of well-doing, and canſt not hold out with God in conflicts and difficulties, as heretofore: thou art not ſo diligent to prepare thy meat in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 25. nor to lay in proviſion for a Winter ſpending-ſeaſon: thou turneſt on thy bed as a door on its hinges, and takeſt little pains with thy heart and converſation: thou loſeſt many an opportunity and advantage for thy Soul through thy deadneſs and indiſpoſition to good works: And doth not this beſpeak Soul-languiſhing, and poverty?</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:132285:45"/>
               <p>There are decays and poverty in thy life al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as well as ſpirit: how unprofitable is now thy converſation, to what it was? there was a time when thy bow did abide in ſtrength, thy lips did diſperſe knowledg, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 7. thy ſteps did drop fatneſs: it was good to be in thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, few came from thee but were better'd. But, alas! now, how dwindling is thy light? how jejune and ſapleſs is thy converſe? thy company little lovely, thy communications lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle profitable; thy words eat as doth a Canker, it ſears as a hot Iron, and deadens thoſe that hear it; thy breath freezes all that come hear it, ſo unprofitable a burden is thy company. <hi>We turn all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Sedgwick'<hi>s Chriſt's counſel to his languiſhing Church.</hi>
                  </note> (ſaith one) <hi>into a diſcourſe, cenſure or diſpute: We can eat, and drink, and talk, and ſin as freely.</hi> This is a ſad caſe indeed, and beſpeaks great decays of godlineſs, when perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more poor, and impotent in their Souls.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Small adventures in Traders, do uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beſpeak bad Trading; when times are hard, and Goods go not off, Sellers buy but little, and drive a leſs Trade when improvements fail; men are loath to adventure the principal, but preſently contract their Trade, and leſſen their dealings. So 'tis in this ſpiritual Trade, when Souls begin to decay in it, and Trading is bad, they narrow up their Trade, and lay out leſs of their heart and ſtrength about it; little of their Soul goes out after God, and things above; they cannot adventure for God, as formerly; nor ſpare time for prayer, hearing, reading, holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:132285:45"/> as once they could; the ſtream of their affections begins to run another way; now they are all for the world, ſelf, and vanity; buſineſs and intereſt eats up all their time; or at leaſt, they ſay to Chriſt, as <hi>David</hi> did to <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, (Thou and</hi> Zibah <hi>divide the Land;</hi>) So, thou and the world, thou and pleaſures, thou and reputation divide my heart, time and ſtrength: this is too evident; God hath not ſo much of mens hearts, deſires, love, delight, faith, hope, zeal, as heretofore: 'tis low waters all the year long with many; no heart to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the Prophet complains; <hi>Whoredom and Wine take away the heart, Hoſ.</hi> 4. 11. So luſt, ſloth, the world, and ſelf, take away the heart; few breathings after God, when abſent; or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, when preſent; indiſpoſed to duty, cold, formal in duty; put off God with any thing; keep the beſt of the flock, the prime of their ſtrength for themſelves and the world; and turn off the Lord with a corrupt thing, the reſidue of their waſted affections and ſtrength, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Breaking ſhews bad Trading, when men can hold it no longer, but are forc'd to give over; they go back, and waſte ſo faſt, that at laſt they ſhut up ſhop, and are gone. The times we live in are a manifeſt inſtance of this truth; men breaking ever and anon, now one, then another; declares plainly Trading is bad. And thus 'tis with Wiſdom's Merchants this day; how many that have driven a brave trade of Profeſſion, made a great ſhew of Religion, were famous in their generation for Parts, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:132285:46"/> ſeeming Piety; but are now come to nothing, quite fallen and gone; great apoſtaſies from the truth, ſad ſhipwracks of Faith and Conſcience can theſe late times ſpeak of! Men that ſeem'd like Stars, to give a blaze for a while, and then turn'd to falling Meteors at laſt: or, with the Sun, that riſeth in a ſplendour, and ſets in a cloud: The viſible apoſtacy, and groſs debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of men profeſſing God in theſe latter times, is great; but the ſecret degeneracy, and backſlidings of heart, are much more: many break, but more do warp. 'Tis far eaſier to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, than to be affected with mens great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſions in Religion; ſome in principle, but moſt in practice; ſome with the fallen Angels have left their habitation, and fallen from their firſt ſtate; others faulter in their profeſſion, and are fallen in their ſtation: ſome with ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my winds are ſhaken down; others fully ripe, and gotten to the height of their profeſſion, looſen by degrees, and drop away: ſome fall from the tree, others rot where they hang; ſome trees have loſt their fruit, others their very leaves, and are become twice dead: where can you caſt your eye, and not ſee fallings away either from Faith, or faithfulneſs? Men take up notions, and as eaſily leave them; moſt build upon the ſand, little rootings in the truth: how eaſy is it to draw men from their opinions? little ſtedfaſtneſs in love: how ſoon doth the labours thereof ceaſe? a little trouble makes men let go their profeſſion, others loſe their ſtrictneſs in Religion, and grow more remiſs and lame in duty, leaving their firſt love, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:132285:46"/> cloſe walks with Gods: And are not theſe ſuch manifeſt ſymptomes of decaying godlineſs, that he who runs may read, and ſee that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Trade is almoſt come to nothing this day?</p>
               <p>2 And this is cauſe of mourning, and to be greatly laid to heart; who can ſee theſe things and not be affected: If there be any quick fleſh, how can it but bleed? if any waters are left, ſurely our eyes ſhould run down tears, and we pour out waters in <hi>Miſpah</hi> before the Lord abundantly, for waſting, gaſping piety, that is even giving up the ghoſt: For where this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Trade decaies,</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a growing ſtrangeneſs between God and ſuch ſouls: While Trade is kept up among men, there is much acquaintance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and intimacy between them; there are ever and anon occaſions of writings, meetings and diſcourſes while trading holds; but when once that is let down, then communion ceaſeth; they have little buſineſs one to another; no more letters paſs, or viſits given; ſeldome ſee one another, and ſo at laſt grow out of acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with each other: And thus 'tis between God and ſouls; when once this Heavenly Trade is let down, a ſtrangeneſs begins between God and them, they are ſeldomer in his company, neither are there ſuch enquiries after God as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy Name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee; for thou haſt hid thy face from us, and haſt conſumed us becauſe of our iniquities, Iſa.</hi> 64. 7. They were ſtrange to God, they did not call upon him as
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:132285:47"/> they uſe to do; and if they did, it was in ſuch a general, cold way, that it ſignified little; they did not take hold of him: The word ſignifieth, <hi>To</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>hold with all their ſtrength,</hi> as men do that are drowning that will not let go what they hold: it ſignifies alſo (<hi>ſaies a Learned Critick</hi>) not onely to hold a thing, but faſter and faſter to wax ſtrong in the holding it: But alas! they did not ſo take hold of God, as ſuch who were like to periſh without him: They did not ſtir up themſelves: They did not waken and rouze up <note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galare vel excitare ſeipſum occultavit ne videatur.</hi>
                  </note> themſelves: (as the word imports) They were grown more remiſs in duty; they did not ſtrive with God for help as they did: And God was ſtrange to them; he hid his face from them; he concealed himſelf, that he might not be ſeen, (as the word ſignifies) he ſeems not to care for their company: This made the Prophet cry out, <hi>Why ſhouldeſt thou be as a ſtranger in the Land, and as a wayfaring man, who turneth aſide to tarry but for a night? Jer.</hi> 14. 18. Seldome vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, and ſhort ſtayes, ſhews ſtrangeneſs in them that have been intimate; and ſo 'tis between God and ſuch who neglect this Heavenly Trade; the Lord ſeldome viſits them, nor hath ſuch warm converſes with them as before: And is not this cauſe of mourning, when ſuch a friend as God hath been to his people, and one on whom all their hope lies, and in whom all their help is, ſhall look ſtrange upon them, and take no notice of them? This is enough to break an ingenuous heart, and one that knows what it is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:132285:47"/> to enjoy God: Neither is it onely the preſent want of God is their ſuffering; but by this means they are in danger of loſing him quite: <hi>The Lord is with you while you are with him; and if you ſeek him, he will be found of you; but if you forſake him, he will forſake you, 2 Chron.</hi> 15. 2. Hence the Prophet, when he apprehended a change in God's carriage towards <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the next thing he fears, is his departure from them; he no ſooner complains of God's ſtrangeneſs, but preſently praies, <hi>Leave us not, Jer.</hi> 14. 9. When once it came to a ſtraitening, and loathing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his people, then terrible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments follow; <hi>My ſoul loathed them, and their ſoul abhorred, me, Zach.</hi> 11. 8, 9, 'Tis in the Original, My ſoul was ſtraitened in them: God's heart was not towards them as formerly; he could not bear with them as formerly: And then, <hi>I will not feed them, that that dies, let it die, and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off;</hi> he matters not what becomes of them: Do but think in what a caſe are ſuch a people: This ſhould be for a lamentation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Soul-poverty, and waſtings of their ſpiritual intereſts, do uſually attend neglect of this Heavenly Trading. When men come to ſpend upon the ſtock, and have no comings in, they muſt needs waſte apace: So it is where trading for Heaven is neglected; ſuch have no recruits of their waſted graces, nor ſupplies of their impoveriſhed ſouls, when the fountain is ſhut up, and all communication of grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held; no entercourſe between God and them; he will not receive their goods, nor impart his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:132285:48"/> treaſure but all waies of relief are blocked up; then they muſt needs waſte apace in ſpirituals, and become poorer every day. The way to be rich, is to have ſtore of Chriſt's tryed gold: <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me gold tryed in the fire, that thou mayeſt be rich, Rev. 3. 18. Laodicea</hi> was poor, becauſe ſhe wanted Chriſt's tryed gold, the real graces of his Spirit; and this ſhe loſt by letting down her Spiritual Trade; ſhe did not buy of Chriſt; ſhe did not come to, and deal with Chriſt in his own waies, and upon his own terms, and that made her poor: And ſo 'tis with every ſoul that neglects this Heavenly Trade; he ſoon comes to know what ſoul-wants are: Once let down a life in godlineſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently poor in graces, poor in experiences, poor in comforts, poor in hopes, want ſtrength, and want peace, fare hard, lodge badly, caſt out from among men; as <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes poor and mean perſons: <hi>Who cut up mallows by the buſhes, and Juniper roots for their meat, Job</hi> 30. 4 5. 6.

                  </note> and yet the uſual feeding in thoſe parts, of thoſe that were low in the world; neither was their lodging better: <hi>They dwelt in the clefts of the Valley, in caves of the Earth, and in the Rocks:</hi> Suitable alſo was their reputation; <hi>They were driven from among men, they cried after them, as after a thief.</hi> Such is the condition of poor perſons full of ſtraits, and meanly eſteemed; and ſo 'tis with ſuch as decay in their Heavenly Trade; they have loſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:132285:48"/> their ſweet morſels, and marrowy bits; their pleaſant fare, and ſoul-refreſhments they once had, and feed on dry bones, and ſapleſs Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: They are not maintain'd at that rate of comfort and experience they once had: They have hard lodging alſo; loſe that ſweet reſt and peace they ſometimes found in Chriſt, and in their ſincere walkings after him: Fal'n in repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation too; neither God nor good men think ſo well of them as once they did. This is the caſe of ſuch as fall back in Religion; they ſoon fall into ſuch poverty, and ſpiritual wants come upon them, as armed men: <hi>In the fulneſs of their ſufficiency they are in ſtraits, Prov. 24. 34. Job</hi> 20. 22. And this is cauſe of mourning; wants and poverty do fill men with trouble, perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and grief: Oh the diſtractions and diſtreſſing thoughts that ſtraits commonly beget! and no ſtraits like to ſoul-ſtraits; Chriſtians, you your ſelves be my Judges.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Neglect of Trading for Heaven will blaſt all other Trading, and breed a moth to conſume even your temporal ſubſtance: When <hi>Iſrael</hi> began to let down their Heavenly Trade, and to mind their own concerns and houſes above God's, preſently God blaſts their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intereſts; he makes holes in their money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bags, and blows upon their encreaſe: All their tuggings in the world (with neglect of God and his Worſhip) came to nothing; they ſowed much, and it brought in little; looked for much, and it came to little; wrought hard, earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great wages, laid up money, but it fell out again, through ſome ſecret hole in their bags,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:132285:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> which divine jealouſie opened, conſuming their ſubſtance, to let them know, that men may make more haſte than good ſpeed; and they that reckon without God, muſt reckon twice. And may not this be one thing that cuts this Nation ſhort in their outward intereſt this day, becauſe they have forſaken God, neglected his ſervice, loſt the power of godlineſs? certainly though outward proſperity be no token of God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, nor any Goſpel-promiſe to his people; yet when the Lord does fight againſt a people by ſucceſſive rebukes, and ſend in a ſecret mildew, waſting and conſumption on their intereſts, and this becomes general and national, it ſhews diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure in God, and ſhould be laid to heart; the want of which is ſet forth as an additional aggravation to ſuch a peoples ſin: <hi>Who gave Jacob for a ſpoil, and Iſrael to the robbers? did not he againſt whom we have ſinned? for they would not walk in his waies, neither were they obedient unto his Laws: Therefore he poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the ſtrength of battel, and hath ſet him on fire round about, yet he knew not, and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart, Iſa.</hi> 42. 24, 25. It was the not walking in the way of God, neglect of obedience and practical holineſs, a letting down the Heavenly Trade that brought thoſe ruining judgments on <hi>Iſrael;</hi> loſſes on their intereſts, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. They were robbed and ſpoiled, firing their houſes, <hi>verſ. 25. It hath ſet him on fire round, it burned him.</hi> Now in this miſerable caſe there was yet a greater judgement on them, a ſtrange ſtupefaction and inſenſibleneſs of ſpirit; they did not ſee God's
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:132285:49"/> anger in it, yet, <hi>Yet he knew it not; (viz.</hi>) Whence it came, and who did all this; they looked to <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and enemies, but 'twas God did it; and yet they laid it not to heart; they were not rightly affected with all theſe deſolations, and their near approach to ruine: And is not this our caſe? God hath warned us by his Word this many years, threatened us by prodigious ſigns in Heaven and Earth, begun to execute them already, by Plague, Sword and Fire, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful waſtes in the great City, and many other places, to the undoing of many families, made a breach upon the Trade of the Nation, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhing of the whole Land; and yet we are as inſenſible as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were, as if the Lord had ſent the ſpirit of ſlumber upon us; impoveriſhed, yet fell it not: This ſhould be for a lamentation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The decay of this Heavenly Trade, if not cured, is the ready and certain way to ruine: <hi>The deſtruction of the poor is poverty, Prov.</hi> 10. 15. Mens poverty fills them with conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and dejecting fears, and does alſo expoſe them to many evils, and take down their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal defence from injuries, being made a prey to their oppreſſours. <hi>The rich man's wealth is his ſtrong City, Prov.</hi> 18. 11. Rich men protect themſelves from injuries; their riches are Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for them to men; but poor men lye open to all invaſions; when men grow poor every man treads upon them: So is it when the Heavenly Trade decaies, and ſoul-poverty ſprings out of its ruine; then deſtruction makes haſte to ſuch places and perſons: For this the Lord
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:132285:50"/> Jeſus threatens to take the Kingdom from a people, becauſe they bring not forth the fruit of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 43. they did not render to God the fruit of all his dreſſings and waitings on them: Barrenneſs and decaies in Religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, are a certain forerunner of Deſolation, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 7, 9.</p>
               <p>Before the Lord brought in that cruel Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Vandals</hi> on <hi>Africa;</hi> the Chriſtians in <hi>Spain</hi> were much degenerated from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer purity (as <hi>Salvian</hi> complains) and the power of godlineſs was much decayed; he tells us, they had nothing left but the name of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to which their converſation was moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. <note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Quid eſt in quo nobis de Chriſtiano nomine blandia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur? Cum utique hoc ipſo magis per nomen ſacratiffimum rei ſimus qui a ſancto nomine diſcrepamus.</hi> Salvi. de Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bern. lib. 3. pag. 95.</note> 
                  <hi>What is it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to pleaſe our ſelves with the name of Chriſtian, when the very name does greaten our guilt, in that we are ſo unlike to it? Before the Maſſacre at</hi> Paris (ſaith Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> in his Martyrol.) <hi>ſuch a general ſtupidity ſeized upon the Proteſtants, that their minds were very wavering, and few there were that ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves zealouſly bent to Religion; but all, both great and ſmall, were intent upon worldly matters, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves goodly Caſtles in the air.</hi> It was obſerved by ſome, that before the change of Religion and Martyrdom in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s daies, there was great unprofitableneſs under the Means of Grace. What the iſſues of theſe great decaies in Religion may be amongſt us, we know not; but ſuch ſymptomes have uſually foregone
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:132285:50"/> great changes, and ſevere ſtroaks, on ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and places: And is not this matter of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation? Phyſitians uſe to cure a Lethargy by a Fever; the one hath been our diſeaſe, O that the other, if no means elſe will do, may be our cure.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, At the beſt decaies in this Heavenly Trade will render the Traders account heavy in the day of Chriſt. Into what ſtraits did the ſenſe of an abuſed truſt put the Prodigal Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 13? He had been unfaithful in his place, waſted his Maſters goods, and now was in danger of being turned out; a reckoning was call'd for, and he unable to render it; and in perplexing thoughts how to give in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and to ſecure his future welfare: And this will be the caſe of ſuch as are negligent and unfaithful in their Heavenly Trade; it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to ſoul-trouble one day, how to anſwer it before God: Firſt or laſt God will call for an account how his goods have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: He hath given you a ſtock to trade up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for him: Light, Grace, Parts, Capacities, Goſpel-priviledges and Opportunities, Liberty, Peace, Experiences, with many mercies and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which are all your Lord's goods, and muſt be accounted for; upon the paſſing of which depends your eternal ſtate, or much of your ſoul's peace: The Lord Jeſus hath a double audit, or accounting with his ſervants: In this life in the Court of Conſcience; and in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Day at the bar of God: In the firſt your preſent peace and ſoul comfort is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and your eternal welfare in the laſt:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:132285:51"/> Alas! how will you anſwer conſcience now when that book is opened, and the Lord Jeſus brings in his bill of ſo many mercies expended, with skill and capacity to improve them; and ſuch a charge of debt iſſuing thence: So much due for ſuch goods, and for other wares; for Sermons, Sacraments, Graces, Comforts, Frames, Prayer Returns, Gracious Providences and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections; ſo many perſonal mercies, ſo many family mercies, ſo many bodily mercies, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſoul mercies, ſo many Church mercies, ſo many National mercies, ſick-bed mercies, health mercies, journey mercies, habitation mercies, caring mercies, ſparing mercies, giving mercies, forgiving mercies, ſeen mercies, unſeen mercies; and little or no return yet made for all theſe: How can the conſcience ſtand up under ſuch a charge, or lift up his face without ſpot, when it ſees its guilt in all, and cannot anſwer one of a thouſand? <hi>How ſhall man be juſt with God, if he contend with him? How ſhall he anſwer him one of a thouſand?</hi> And if you cannot carry it in the Court of Conſcience here, where God reckons by a Proxy; and it may be doth give but a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral charge, what will you do at the bar of God, where the Lord will judge righteous judgment, and determine your eternal ſtate, as you are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved or diſapproved in that day? What think you ſouls, will not ſo much neglect of duty? ſuch decaies of grace? ſo frequent breach of Covenants? ſo great unfaithfulneſs in your places and relations? ſo many daies and weeks, and not a ſtroke of work for God? ſo much bad work, ſo much waſte of goods; will not all this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:132285:51"/> look wiſtly upon you, and without repentance and a ſealed acquittance, render your caſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous at the judgment ſeat? And if ſo, is it not matter of lamentation? O lay this to heart!</p>

               <p>Thirdly, If the Heavenly Trade be the beſt Trade; then this reproves mens too greedy and inordinate purſuit of their earthly Trades and Intereſts, to the great prejudice and hinderance of this Heavenly Trade: And oh that I could here dip my Pen in tears, as well as gall; and not onely write againſt, but weep over this earthly ſpiritedneſs, the great, the common, the uncur'd diſeaſe of men; almoſt of all men, of good men, this day! With what earneſtneſs, ſtrength of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and indefatigable labours, do men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue after the things of this world, as if all their pleaſure, happineſs, yea life and eternal welfare lay wrapt up in theſe things. <hi>Jehu</hi> did not more furiouſly drive after a Crown, then men do this day after crumbs. There was a time to ſome when godlineſs was counted gain; but now gain is valued beyond godlineſs. <hi>Trade</hi> is the great <hi>Diana</hi> to which moſt men ſacrifice: <hi>Profit</hi> the wheel within the wheel, which ſets all a going: The ſalt that ſeaſons all things; nothing ſavours well that hath not this in it. <hi>Advantage in the world,</hi> is like the blood in mens veins; the ſoul in the body; that quickens their deſires, puts life into their dead hopes; makes the blind to ſee, the lame to leap and run, the deaf to hear, the lips of them that are aſleep to ſpeak. <hi>Gain</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:132285:52"/> is the whetſtone to mens wits, the loadſtone to their affections, the ſpur to their actions: this is the object of mens quickeſt ſenſes, the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their livelieſt motions. O! the projects, cares, tuggings, ſweats, rowings, ridings, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs labours, that are engag'd about this enquiry: <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how may we know when men do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately purſue their earthly buſineſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns?</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt, When they engroſs too much of their time: this was <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ſin, ſaying, <hi>When will the New-Moon be gone, that we may ſell Corn? and the Sabbath, that we may ſet forth Wheat? Amos</hi> 8. 5. They were not contented with their own time but they muſt entrench on God's time alſ. they thought the time long till they were at their worldly work, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to get advantage from God's inſtitutions, for their earthly intereſts; and that the Jubilee-Sabbath, when men muſt ceaſe from tillage, would help to heighten the price of things, and ſo further their advantage: therefore the Lord reproves them for their undue diligence about the World: <note n="a" place="bottom">

                  <hi>'Tis in vain for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:132285:52"/> them to riſe up ſo early to their work, and ſit up ſo late in their ſhops, for ſuch poor and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible gain:</hi> So <hi>Rabbi Solomon</hi> renders it for <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, who riſe early to their labours.</hi> Exceſſive purſuits of the World in point of time are here reprov'd as vain and ſinful, while hereby they deprive themſelves of time for God and their Souls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when they lay out their Hearts on the World; <hi>If riches encreaſe, ſet not your hearts on them, Pſal.</hi> 62. 10. The danger of a diſeaſe lies in its ſeiſure on the heart: Earthly things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand are a duty; but in the heart, a diſeaſe. The heart is Chriſt's Royal Fort, to which the Devil, the World and Fleſh lay ſiege; and if that be taken, all is gone: Earthly things are briars and thorns, and therefore dangerous to come near the heart: the leaſt prick at the heart is mortal; the heart is Chriſt's nuptial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, into which Chriſt retires; the World is the Saint's ſervant; now to admit a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant into the Lord's bed, is adulterous: the heart is God's Seat, Pavilion and Throne, into which none muſt come but himſelf; like the gates of the Sanctuary, into which none muſt enter but God himſelf: <hi>This gate ſhall be ſhut, it ſhall not be opened, and no man ſhall enter into it; becauſe the Lord, the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into it; therefore it ſhall be ſhut, Ezek.</hi> 44. 2. Such is the heart of Believers, to be kept for God only; to take in creatures into God's room, is intolerable boldneſs; to let out thy heart to the World, Trade, Intereſt, Creatures, is to invert the order of nature, as well as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:132285:53"/> grace. In creation, God ſets man uppermoſt, and puts all things under his feet: <hi>Thou madeſt him to have dominion over the works of thine hands; thou haſt put all things under his feet, Pſal.</hi> 8. 6. Now, to place thoſe things over thy heart, which God hath ſet under thy feet, is to turn the World upſide down, and to overturn the whole courſe of nature. This is the great ſin of this day, mens letting out their hearts on the things of this World: were perſons but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and willing to be ſearch'd, and to know their own ſtate, many that think well of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, might find, that notwithſtanding all their ſhews, and ſeeming hopes, they are in a woful and dangerous caſe, in that their hearts are not right with God, but are ſet on other things, on earthly things more than on God.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Six things diſcover this, that the heart is ſet too much upon this World.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, When the deſires are inordinately let out after it: this is one ſymptom the Prophet gives of an unſound, covetous heart; ſuch a one hath greedy, unſatisfied deſires after the World; <hi>Who enlargeth his deſire as Hell, and is as Death, and cannot be ſatisfied, Hab.</hi> 2. 5. In the former verſe he tells us, a carnal unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving heart, is a rotten unſound heart: <hi>His ſoul which is lifted up, is not upright in him: but the juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> A carnal heart is all for himſelf, and his own carnal intereſt, and not for God; he lives by ſight, and not by Faith; and this was an evidence of it, all his deſires
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:132285:53"/> were for carnal things. Deſires are the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and outgoings of the heart, and as the heart is, ſuch are they; where the deſires are earthly, the heart is earthly; ſuch a one is never ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with any portion of earthly things: as a perſon in a Fever, always thirſty; ſo is an earthly heart, always coveting more and more: <hi>They joyn houſe to houſe, and lay field to field, till there be no place, Iſa.</hi> 5. 8. As long as there is any place left, they covet it: A Field, a Houſe, a Living, is but a morſel that ſtays a hungry ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach for the preſent, as ſoon as that is digeſted they long for more: this is a certain ſign that heart is on the World, whoſe deſires have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enough of it: and alas! where's the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that will ſay with <hi>Jacob, I have enough?</hi> Where the heart is ſet on God and things above, a little of the World will content that Soul; food and rayment, with godlineſs, is enough; but it is never ſatisfied with its meaſure of Grace, and enjoyment of God; the more it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys of God, the more it longs for further fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him; one duty doth but edge the ſtomach for another: the more he hath, the more he deſires of God and ſpiritual things: and ſo 'tis with a heart that is altogether earthly, the deſires are earthly alſo, never ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with what he hath, but ſtill longing for more.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A worldly heart hath worldly thoughts; there the mind is wholly taken up about earthly things; thoughts are to the heart as the beams are to the Sun, the ſtreams to the Fountain, which are homogeneous, of the ſame
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:132285:54"/> nature with them; our Lord Jeſus tells us, that 'tis out of the heart that evil thoughts proceed, <hi>Mark. 7. 21. They come immediately from the heart,</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Fenner,) nothing comes between the heart and them; other ſins</hi> (ſays he) <hi>come from the heart, but it is at the ſecond, third and fourth hand; but thoughts come immediately from it:</hi> And nothing doth more diſcover the heart, than the uſual, habitual, delightful thoughts of a man do: <hi>They are the univocal acts of the heart, which ſhew what the heart is, as ſhining does the light;</hi> Mr. <hi>Fenner</hi> of the miſery of earthly thoughts. Where are thy thoughts moſtly? thy pleaſing and delightful thoughts? there is thy Heart: <hi>They that are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 8. 5. As ſoon as they awake, thoughts of their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs (as friends) come to viſit them; they drive out other thoughts of God and heavenly things, they vaniſh and diſappear at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of earthly thoughts, as Clouds do at the riſing-Sun; as when a Maſter comes in to take his ſeat, Servants riſe up, and go their way: no ſooner doth thoughts of God come in, but earthly thoughts drive them away, as the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds did <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Daughters, and there is no <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſtand up and help them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. 16, 17. An earthly man from morning to night his thoughts are upon the World, as the Dog fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his Maſter all the day long: In company, alone, at home, abroad, in journeys, in duties; his thoughts are uſually about his Trade, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, Houſe, Field, Work, and the like; it may be ſometimes good thoughts may be caſt into
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:132285:54"/> the mind, and theſe make amends for all other thoughts, feeding the deceived heart with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits that all is well, becauſe good thoughts come in now and then; whereas the main bent of their thoughts have been about earthly things: theſe thoughts grow out of the heart, they are in-dwellers; but good thoughts are only gueſts and ſtrangers that don't ſtay long; they give a viſit, and then are gone, and muſt give way to earthly thoughts again, which are home-born, houſhold-ſervants and inhabitants: thy thoughts of God are but occaſional, now and then extraordinary, when ſome ſpecial mercy or affliction is upon thee, but thy earthly thoughts are fixed, ſtated and continued: thy good thoughts are like rain-water, that fall upon thee, or as pump-water that muſt be drawn out; but thy carnal thoughts are as well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, that runs freely, and ſprings up from within thee: thy good thoughts are but thy recreation, when thy mind is tired with other things; but thy earthly thoughts are thy work and employment; when men have done their work, they ſometimes walk abroad; ſuch are thy ſeldom thoughts of God and divine things, when thou haſt drudg'd away the ſtrength of thy mind on the World, and thy own things, then, to quiet conſcience, and recreate thy mind, thou giveſt thy thoughts leave to walk abroad, and give a viſit to better things: thy heavenly thoughts are gentle, eaſy, weak and ſickly, and carry out little of the ſtrength and vigour of thy heart with them; but thy thoughts of the World are ſtrong and lively,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:132285:55"/> the firſt-born and ſtrength of thy heart; they are ſpending thoughts, working, plotting, cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtudying thoughts: Ah ſouls! deceive not your ſelves with fancies of your good eſtate, from ſome fits and good moods in you (which hypocrites may have) and all the while the ſtrength and bent of your hearts, the conſtant, lively, prevailing thoughts of your ſouls are carnal, ſelfiſh and earthly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Perſons reſtleſs labours after the world, plainly ſhew their hearts are upon it: Where the heart is ſet upon a thing a perſon is reſtleſs till he hath it; he leaves no ſtone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; ſets wit, hands, friends, and all on work to get it. When <hi>Shechem</hi>'s heart was ſet on <hi>Dinah, Jacob</hi>'s daughter, he ſticks at no propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals ſo he might but obtain her: <hi>Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye ſhall ſay unto me, I will give; the Land ſhall be before you, dwell and trade therein, and get you poſſeſſion therein, Gen.</hi> 34. 10, 11. No terms were counted too hard; take up profeſſion, undergo painful duties, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumciſion; part with any thing ſo he might but have the deſire of his heart, What hardſhips did <hi>Jacob</hi> undergo for his beloved <hi>Rachel?</hi> twice ſeven years ſervice, conſumed with drought in the day, and froſt in the night, and his ſleep departed from his eyes: <hi>Thus have I been twenty years in thy houſe; I ſerved thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and ſix years for thy cattel, and thou haſt changed my wages ten times, Gen.</hi> 31. 40, 41. And yet all this he could bear to enjoy the object of his love.</p>

Wicked men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in their abominations, and that proves their ways to be of choice. <hi>Iſa. 63. 3, They have choſen their own ways, and their ſoul delighteth in their abominations:</hi> Try thy heart by thy pleaſure; what is ſweeteſt to thy taſte, God or the World? What is moſt delightful to thee, to wait on God, though with the loſs of the world, or to purſue the world, with the want of God? Men cheat their own Souls, when they ſay the enjoyment of God is better than the world; and yet for every trifle, and ſmalleſt advantage, can upon choice, baulk the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in his appointments, and cannot adventure the leaſt loſs and prejudice to their intereſt, though it were for the neareſt fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God: certainly that which is the Souls greateſt pleaſure, that will it make after when left to its liberty: Canſt thou leave the

Thy affections will be like the Kine that drew the Ark to <hi>Bethſhemeſh,</hi> that lowed after their Calves as they went, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 12. When thou art conſtrained to draw in the Cart of thy duty-employments, even then will thy deſires belowing after the comfort of thy relation-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God. How is it ſoul? ſpeak; Is not a good Fair and Bargain ſweeter to thee, and doth more affect thy heart, than a ſermon and a duty? Doſt thou not uſe to follow the world with thy back on fellowſhip with God and Saints, and not the leaſt regret in thy ſpirit, or cloud on thy comforts? if ſo, thy heart is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:132285:57"/> not yet ſupremely ſet on God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Lothneſs to part with thy earthly comforts and intereſts tells thee, thy heart is too much upon them. <hi>Jacob</hi>'s unwillingneſs to part with <hi>Benjamin,</hi> was a ſign his heart was too much ſet upon him. <hi>Judah</hi> tells the Governour of <hi>Egypt, That his Father's life was bound up in the Lad's life, Gen.</hi> 44. 30. The Spouſes affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to her Beloved was ſeen in this, that when ſhe found him, ſhe held him, and would not let him go, <hi>Cant. 3. 4. I found him whom my ſoul loveth, I held him, and would not let him go.</hi> Such is the teſtimony, that if mens hearts are on the things of this life, they hold them faſt, and will not let them go: Moſt men are too tenacious of their intereſts, to be dead to them: cloſe hands argue cleaving hearts to the world. Alas! with what reluctancy do men that have the abundance of this worlds goods, lay them out again for God! how hard is it to draw any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of charity from them that have this worlds goods? what arguments and reaſons will men be pleading for their ſparingneſs in parting with the Mammon of this world? and how much beneath their meaſure do moſt men expend their earthly things upon the calls that God gives them? This ſhews plainly, their heart is bound up in the fruition of theſe things. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous men will ſooner part with their fleſh, than their gold</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine) ſhall I take my bread, and my water, and my fleſh that I have killed for my ſhearers, and give it to men whom I know not whence they be? 1 Sam.</hi> 25. 11.

                  <p>Laſtly, Then are mens hearts upon the world, when their truſt and dependence is upon earthly things. We are apt to put confidence in friends, and therefore the Lord cautions <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt ſuch dependencies, as falſe deceiving things: <hi>Truſt not in a friend; put ye not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a guide,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 5. The Spouſe came leaning upon her Beloved in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 5. No ſooner had the rich man ſtore of goods, but he places his confidence in them, <hi>Luke 12. 19. I will ſay to my ſoul; ſoul, thou haſt goods laid up for many years, take thine eaſe; eat, drink and be merry.</hi> 'Tis natural to men that chuſe the world for their treaſure; to chuſe it alſo for their truſt: They that dare ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture their ſupreme affection on things, dare alſo take up their dependency on them. Men <hi>chuſe not a tree they think will rot, Iſa.</hi> 40. 20. If riches be thy choice, thou thinkeſt them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of thy relyance; or thou acteſt irrationally.

'Tis hard to have the good things of this life, and not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect too much from them; ſo inviting is their appearance to a dependency on them: Earthly things are fair in promiſe, but falſe in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance; like quagmires covered with graſs; men think them firm ground, but when they tread upon them, they ſoon become their graves.

                  <p>After you have found better things, and taſted the ſweetneſs of them, you have experienced the light of God's countenance to be beyond all corn, and wine, and oyl; his loving-kindneſs to be better than life; a day in his Courts to be more eligible than a thouſand elſewhere, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. O how ſweet hath his Word been to thy taſte, ſweeter than the honey and the honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb! how often hath God cheered, quickened and ſtrengthened thy heart in thy approaches to him, that thou haſt ſaid (as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s ſword) there is none like this: And as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples when with Chriſt in the Mount, 'tis good being here; Lord evermore give me this bread: and yet after all this, that thou ſhouldeſt upon choice, leave theſe for the world, and prefer thy ſhop, thy trade, thy field, houſe, money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe divine and approved treaſures: This is madneſs.</p>

Sinners, you that are yet without God in the World, you are miſerably poor, and ready to periſh; you are worth nothing but ſin and miſery; He is a poor man that hath nothing to live upon; and ſuch are you, while without this line of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and ſtrangers to theſe ſupreme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns: You are ſpiritually poor, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (as yet) for your Souls to live on here, or to all eternity, <hi>Rev. 3. 17. And knoweſt not that thou art wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> Poverty is one of the miſeries of all unchanged ſouls; and that which aggravates it, is this; that they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rich, and yet have nothing; no Food to fill them, but empty husks, and ſwines meat; no Rayment to cover them, but filthy rags, and confuſion, no Houſe to ſhelter them from the ſtorms of Divine wrath; or any Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to receive them, but an infernal Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, and a receptacle with damned Devils; not a friend to help them; not an eye to pitty them; There are none ſo poor in the World but they have ſomething or other to help them, ſomething in hand, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in hope; ſomething of their own, or ſomething of others: if they can't dig, yet they can beg; if they have not intereſts to maintain them, yet they find pitty to relieve them: But a Chriſtleſs Sinner hath nothing to ſupply his immortal part; nothing in hand; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in hope; nothing of his own; nothing of

Thirdly, Thy duty ſhould quicken thy undertaking in this great employment: Religion is not your Liberty, but your manifold debt: The Law of Creation binds you unto God; you will confeſs you were made by him, and God will profeſs you were made for him, <hi>Iſa. 43. 21. This people have I formed for my ſelf, that they ſhould ſhew forth my praiſe.</hi> Your fall from the Covenant of Works, is not your liberty from the eſſential duties of it; neither is your inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to perform it, a diſpenſation of your obedience: 'tis ſtill your duty to return from whence you fell; to take the Lord to be your God, to love him with all your heart, and with all your might; to truſt in him; to fear and obey him. A draught of theſe Covenant-duties did God place in your conſcience by which you ſhall be judged, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 12. 15. though the counterpane you have defaced; yet the Original Deed is with God, and will be brought forth in the day of Chriſt againſt ſuch as have not taken the Lord for their God.</p>

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Fourthly, Weigh the unſpeakable gain that will ſurely accrew to you, if you ſet up this Trade of Godlineſs. I have already ſhewn in the demonſtration of this point, the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that this Heavenly Trade will turn unto, to all that deal thoroughly in it, to which I adviſe you to caſt back your eye, and take three or four conſiderations more, to convince your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings that Religion is eligible on grounds of greateſt intereſt: For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Religion will maintain you in the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt times: So will not other Trades; there may be ſeaſons when earthly employments will turn to no accounts: You have heard that riches profit not in the day of wrath; and ſome of you have ſeen the time, when they that work could yet ſcarcely eat; but God's work is meat and drink, when daily bread fails, <hi>Joh. 4. 30. I have meat to eat that you know not of. Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. 1 Tim. 4. 8. God careth for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and when the Lions lack, and are hunger-bit, they that fear the Lord ſhall want no good thing, Pſal.</hi> 34. 10. They ſhall be ſure to be provided for, whoever wants: God hath paſt his word for it: All things are theirs by purchaſe, who are Chriſt's by choice; that is (ſaith <hi>Piſcator</hi>) <note n="o" place="bottom">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>All earthly things are deſigned of God for your uſe, and the furtherance of your ſalvation:</hi> Not as if the Saints had a right to other mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. The <hi>Apoſtle doth not ſpeak here</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus) of civil poſſeſſions, but of that divine order by
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:132285:69"/> which all things ought to ſerve the good and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Church of God.</hi> The Earth is the Lord's, &amp; the fulneſs thereof; all which is given into the hands of Chriſt for the good of his people: <hi>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the Church, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 22. The whole Earth is but God's Kitchin, for the maintenance of his houſe; and if he will feed his ſervants and ſlaves, much more his children: <hi>He gives to all their meat in due ſeaſon, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the deſires of every living thing:</hi> Much more will he care for, and give food convenient to his living in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Indeed Believers are not of the world, and therefore have not their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world; they are the Heirs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and have no promiſe of more on Earth than will comfortably carry them home, and ſuffice for the diſcharge of thoſe offices aſſigned to them here: They are Servants, not Heirs, who carry the cloak-bags in their journey. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of grandeur bear no more about them than for preſent uſe: Surely, were earthly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures good for heaven-born ſouls, he that gives better things would not deny theſe: But God knows enough is as good as a feaſt; and ſo much the Saints ſhall have in their paſſage home. No man ſends his ſervants a journey, but he allows them enough to carry them thorough; and ſo will God to his: If he maintains idlers and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; much more will he feed his faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and labourers: He hath promiſed to ſupply all their wants, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19. and is able to make it good: If he thinks it not much to give them a Crown, he will not deny them Crumbs: If
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:132285:70"/> God ſhould let his work-men, want, his work would ceaſe; his own intereſt, as well as his promiſe, obliges him to look after ſuch; his Love, Truth, Glory, with all his Attributes, are concerned to maintain his people in his work; and therefore nothing more ſure than daily bread, and ſufficiency in all things to ſuch as ſerve and obey him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Godlineſs will ſecure you in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times, <hi>Prov. 3. 23. Thou ſhalt then walk in thy way ſafely, and thy foot ſhall not ſtumble; when thou lieſt down, thou ſhalt not be afraid; yea thou ſhalt lie down, and thy ſleep ſhall be ſweet, v. 24. For the Lord ſhall be thy confidence, and ſhall keep thy foot from being taken.</hi> The way of duty is the way of ſafety: whatever men think, the greateſt ſecurity is in the boldeſt Adventures for God (if regular;) where his Sun does guide you, there his ſhadow will cover you; <hi>who ſhall harm you if you are followers of that which is good? 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 13. Men may threaten you, but cannot injure you; they may ſpoil your eſtates, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon your bodies, but cannot do you any real harm; while men keep with God, God will abide with them; his preſence ſhall fence them, his favour ſhall ſhield them, his Angels ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp about them; all his Attributes ſhall guard and ſecure them: God's people that cleave to him in duty, are as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs, as <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark; they onely are ſafe from ruining evils, when others are expoſed to deſtroying judgments.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Nay, Holineſs will not onely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſecure you; but it will alſo enrich you,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:132285:70"/> and fill you with the beſt Treaſures, the true Riches, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 11. the tryed gold that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be corrupted or defrauded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 20. It will furniſh you with the unſearchable riches of Chriſt: the world hath its treaſures; and ſo hath Chriſt his precious ſubſtance, to beſtow on all that trade with and for him; as hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Piety will cheer and delight you; no comforts like theirs who walk with God in truth: This was <hi>Hezekia</hi>'s cordial when under a ſentence of death, <hi>Iſa. 38. 3. Remember O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart:</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi>'s rejoycing, <hi>that in all ſimplicity and godly ſincerity he had his converſation in this world, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 12. The pureſt pleaſures flow down from the Throne, and ſteam in thorough Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary-waters into the ſoul: Alas! what are thoſe droſſy comforts that run thorough the worlds chanels, which onely leave a ſlime behind, and then empty themſelves into the dead Sea of perdition, <hi>periſhing in their uſing, Col.</hi> 2. 22. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mirth hath a pleaſant entrance, but an ill fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, <hi>Prov. 14. 13. Even in laughter the heart is ſorrowfull, and the end of that mirth is heavineſs:</hi> But Religion breeds the beſt contentments, and moſt ſatisfying pleaſures, <hi>Pſal. 36. 8. They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe, and thou ſhalt make them drink of the rivers of thy pleaſures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Wiſdom's Trade will make you tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great and honourable, and give you a place to walk among thoſe that ſtand by, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 7.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:132285:71"/> That is (ſaith <hi>Junius</hi>) <note n="p" place="bottom">

She ſhall give to thine head an Ornament of grace, a Crown of glory ſhall ſhe deliver thee.</hi> How contemptibly ſoever the world looks on the waies of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and thoſe that eſpouſe them; yet all true greatneſs lies on the ſide of piety. All the world's glory is but a Pageant, a meer ſhow of honour, compared to that which is on the head of every true Believer: Saints have the nobleſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, born of God; the higheſt dignity, <hi>made Kings and Prieſts unto God, Rev. 1. 6.

To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit with me in my throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſit down with my Father in his Throne.</hi> A ſure Throne ſhall Believers have above, as certain as Chriſt is now upon his Fathers Throne; and the ſame Throne that the Father gives to Chriſt, <hi>ſpecifically,</hi> though not <hi>gradually:</hi> A Crown fitted to their heads; indeed Saints cannot wear the Crown Chriſt doth; his is the Redeemer's Crown; theirs the Redeemeds, made of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:132285:71"/> ſame glory: <hi>Joh. 17. 24. Father I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me, 2 Tim. 2. 12. If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him.</hi> O bleſſed glory, and greatly to be longed for! whoſe meaſure is incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whoſe duration is undeterminable.</p>

Secondly, if the Heavenly Trade be the beſt Trade; then you that profeſs this Calling, be you exhorted to follow it; keep up and improve your Trade for Heaven: what's an employment without improvement? the moſt profitable Calling not followed, turns to little advantage: The day we live in gives men ſenſible experience of this truth, that they who intend to live in the World, muſt attend their employments: The idle perſon ſuffers hunger; they muſt be careful and diligent in their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that think to make any thing of their earthly intereſts: and ſo 'tis in this Trade of godlineſs; they that will be ſaved, muſt <hi>work out their Salvation.</hi> A Trade is a man's buſineſs, and courſe of life, which he purſues and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on from day to day; 'tis the ſubject of his thoughts, counſels, and conſiderations; of his time and ſtrength, and daily work; where he ends one day, he begins the next, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes his utmoſt wiſdom, parts and labours to the moſt vigorous proſecution of it: And ſo muſt it be in this Heavenly Trade, (Chriſtians,) it muſt be the impending buſineſs, and principal concern of your whole life; that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands your thoughts, purpoſes and capacities;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:132285:80"/> which engroſſes your time, care and ſtrength, and to which every other buſineſs muſt give way, and every occaſion and occurrence muſt be ſubſervient: it muſt be followed, and driven on every day, in every thing, place and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; what-ever is neglected, that muſt go on, and give no place to intermiſſions, no, not for a moment: You muſt not ſay to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as <hi>Felix</hi> did to <hi>Paul; Go thy way for this time, when I have a more convenient ſeaſon I will ſend for thee, Acts</hi> 24. 25. Stops in the way of God are not eaſily recovered; one days neglect brings all out of order: Proſperity in Religion admits of no <hi>Parentheſis</hi> in its work, or conſiſts with allowed interruptions; Piety muſt be as the blood that runs through every vein of your life, and affair in the World: In eating, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, talking, thinking, buying, ſelling, you muſt be ſtill driving on Wiſdom's Merchandiſe. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, follow your work, or lay down your Trade; 'tis vanity, yea, the way to beggery, to profeſs a Calling, and not puſue it.</p>

                  <p>What I intend by this metaphor, I ſhall open to you under theſe ſeven general Heads, as the main duty of a Chriſtian, and to be carried on in the whole courſe of his life.</p>

They that ſet about the work of Religion, muſt be perſons of raiſed ſpirits, capable of aſcending to things above. The reaſon why no more do ſet upon this Heavenly Trade, is, becauſe they want this heavenly ſpirit, their ſpirit is earthly, and that (as leaven) ſeaſons their whole ſouls, and makes their converſations earthly: 'Tis contrary to nature, for a carnal mind to ſavour ſpiritual things; <hi>Such are not ſubject to the Spirit of God, neither indeed can be, Rom.</hi> 8. 7. 'Tis as natural for the ſtone to aſcend, and waters to run back, as for an earthly heart to love and purſue hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things. A heavenly ſpirit ſutes heavenly things, and does as naturally incline the ſoul to things above, as the fire moves upward, and the water carries all that is in it to the Ocean. A heavenly ſpirit ſavours heavenly things, and ſtirs up heavenly deſires and motions to divine things. A heavenly ſpirit conveys out heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influences and ſtrength to the ſoul, and is as good blood and ſpirits that ſtrengthen the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. A heavenly ſpirit is influenced by heavenly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:132285:82"/> arguments, and prevailed with by heavenly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives taken from the love of God, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Chriſt, the ſutableneſs and advantage of ſpiritual things to the nature of the ſoul, the pleaſing and glorifying of God; all which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing to an earthly and carnal heart, which only underſtands, ſavours, and is acted by carnal reaſons and conſiderations. 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a principal part of a Chriſtian's buſineſs in this Heavenly Trade, (and that which is leading to all other duties) to take heed to his ſpirit, <hi>Mai.</hi> 2. 15. to get and keep that pure and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. If the fountain be corrupt, the ſtreams cannot be good: Get your minds beam'd over with heavenly light, to diſcern heavenly things, their nature and worth; this <hi>Paul</hi> begs for the Saints at <hi>Epheſus; Eph. 1. 17, 18. That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the ſpirit of wiſdom and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the knowledg of him; the eyes of your underſtanding being enlighten'd, that you may know what is the hope of his Calling, and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints.</hi> There are great hopes and glorious riches made over to Believers in the Goſpel, the knowledg of which is neceſſary to chear the heart, and engage the ſoul with all its ſtrength to make out after them. <hi>One thought of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Ball) reaching the heart, is more to be valued than all Creature-contentments whatſoever, though they ſhould be enjoyed in their fulneſs for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years without interruption:</hi> 'Twas this kept alive the Apoſtles hearts, under the dyings of the Lord Jeſus in their bodies, and fill'd them
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:132285:82"/> with ſuch courage &amp; joy, that they had an eye to ſee glorious and eternal things. 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 10. 13. 16. 18.

And having got this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual eye, a Chriſtian's duty is to keep it open, and fixt on things above, to preſerve it from the injury of Sin and Satan, to take heed of the vapours of a carnal heart, and the duſty motes of this lower World, that they fall not in and weaken this ſight: to get eye-ſalve from Chriſt, and pure annointings of the ſpirit on it every day, that they may ſee things inviſible, and thoſe great things of the other World they are engag'd about: The moſt diſcerning eye on this ſide the everlaſting Hills ſees but darkly through a glaſs, and knows but in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. 12.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:132285:84"/> your ſpiritual ſenſes in exerciſe, that your ſouls may be ever quick in ſeeing, hearing, taſting, ſmelling and feeling, the joyes and pleaſures that are in things above: By this means Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will be deſirable, Chriſt's yoke eaſie, and his waies pleaſant, and his commands not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, This is one of the moſt difficult pieces of Chriſtianity, to maintain the inward principle and ſpring of holy actions pure and lively: 'Tis far eaſier to ſet on any external duty, than to keep the heart in a fit active frame for God, which is apt to languiſh and grow out of order every moment, if not kept and maintained by continued ſupplies from above. <hi>Prov. 4. 23. Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the iſſues of Life.</hi> Now if you would keep up a heavenly ſpirit:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Beware of thoſe things that weaken it: A Heavenly Spirit is a very tender thing, and muſt be charily kept, or will ſoon ſuffer loſs; 'tis like the apple of the eye, that is liable to injury from every duſt or ſtroak that comes nigh it; or like a Venice-glaſs, that is down and broken with every little touch. You cannot be too choice and tender in watching and guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Spirit from every thing that is contrary to it.</p>
                  <p>Take heed of carnal luſts, theſe ſtand between God and the ſoul, and theſe reſiſt the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. and fight againſt the ſoul. 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 11. Dearly Beloved, I beſeech you as ſtrangers and pilgrims, abſtain from fleſhly luſts, that war againſt the ſoul.</hi> Water is as conſiſtent with fire, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with health, death with life, as unmortified
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:132285:84"/> luſts with a heavenly ſpirit; and you may as ſafely dwell with thieves and bloody murderers, as ſuffer fleſhly luſts to harbour near your hearts: Theſe ſuffered to hover in the ſoul, will devour your ſacrifice; and like water, quench this ſacred fire; and with the Ivy, eat out the nouriſhment of this heaven-born ſpirit. When <hi>Alexander</hi> asked <hi>Diogenes</hi> what he would deſire of him; that you (ſaith he) would ſtand aſide a little from between me and the warm Sun: ſo a ſoul that knows what the views of God are, will deſire nothing more than the remove of what ſtands between him and the warming ſight of this heavenly Sun. Carnal luſts are as venemous breath, that ſoon ſeize on, and weaken the vitals of godlineſs: Never expect peace or welfare to the ſpiritual ſeed, till the bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and her Son be caſt out. How ſoon have excellent frames been all loſt, and the candle of the Lord well-nigh put out by theſe filthy damps that aſcend from the deeps of unclean and unmortified affections. This wrought ſuch changes in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> now they ſang his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and then preſently forgat his works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 12.

They luſted exceedingly in the wilderneſs, and tempted God in the Deſart, and he gave them their requeſts, but ſent leanneſs into their ſouls.</hi> This ſoon brought the Jews from being conquerours, to captives, that they did not purſue their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, and drive out the <hi>Canaanites</hi> out of the valleys, as well as the mountains, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1. 19.

This want of mortification in Believers is the cauſe that their corruptions do ſo often give check to their graces, and make their choice heavenly frames ſo ſhort-liv'd and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.

                  <p>Earthly things alſo admitted too near the heart, prove the bane of a heavenly ſpirit: theſe, like a ſtone at the bird's leg, pluck it down when it attempts to be upon the wing: Worldly affections, when they exceed their bounds, are like waters that overflow the banks; they carry down all heavenly motions before them. Earthly things are the Devils lure to profeſſing Chriſtians, which draw down their lofty meditations, when they are in chaſe of things above; as the Fowler allures down the towring Lark when hovering aloft in the gentle air. The Devil deals with earthly men, as Naturaliſts ſay men do with Bees; <hi>when they ſwarm and are flying away, they throw up duſt, and they ſcatter again:</hi> So doth Satan when their thoughts are up upon heavenly things; he caſts in the duſty thoughts of this world, and they ſcatter them again. <hi>Demas hath forſaken us, having loved this preſent world, 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 10. Earthly things draw away the heart from God, his work and intereſt: How often do thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt, if not countermand the moſt ſerious thoughts of gracious ſouls? and where they
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:132285:85"/> cannot as a Maſter command, they will as neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours be often coming in, and hinder the ſoul in its moſt weighty buſineſs, if the door be not lockt againſt their unſeaſonable viſits. Worldly luſts muſt be denied, as well as ungodlineſs, by thoſe that intend to live righteouſly, ſoberly and godly in this preſent world, <hi>Tit. cap. 2. v.</hi> 11, 12. Earthly things are good ſervants, but bad Maſters; uſeful in their place; as fire in the hearth is profitable, but in the thatch danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and as unruly Servants, and untamed Colts are ſerviceable when reduced to their place, and kept under government. Worldly thoughts are as ſome roots that muſt be often trod down, or they will ſpill up and ſeed in our hearts. Chriſtians, have a ſpecial ſtrong guard againſt the encroachments of your earthly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, if ever you will ſecure the thrivings of a heavenly ſpirit,</p>
                  <p>Take heed alſo of grieving the Spirit of Grace, which maintains and relieves this heavenly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: As the ſpring is to the ſtreams; ſo is the holy Spirit to this heavenly ſpirit in Believers, that feeds and ſupplies it from his own nature: Now to grieve this Spirit, is to provoke him to withhold his gracious communications to the ſoul. <hi>Epheſ. 4. 30. And grieve not the holy Spirit of God whereby you are ſealed to the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Which implies, that this Spirit of Grace being grieved, ſuſpends its comforting ſealing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences towards the ſouls of Believers.

Pſa.</hi> 104. 29. As the member languiſhes when it can no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger receive influences from the head; and the branch withers when the root communicates no ſap to it: ſo is it with the ſoul when the ſpirit ceaſes from all its gracious communications, as it does when grieved by thoſe he loves and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with; not as if the Divine Spirit could be capable of paſſions and perturbations, as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are: But then may the holy Spirit be ſaid to be grieved, when gracious ſouls do that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:132285:86"/> which is enough to grieve one that tenderly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects us, and by all means ſeeks our eternal good. Now two things uſually grieve ſuch a one: Firſt, Injuries from a friend. Secondly, The ſufferings of a friend. Unkindneſs from thoſe we love, does uſually ſit nearer our hearts, than any injuries from ſtrangers or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: we uſually expect more regard from ſuch, and therefore are more troubled at diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments: And ſuch is the tenderneſs of the Spirit to Believers, that want of love, or injurie from ſuch is more abuſive, and carries in it all that which in its nature is grieving. Again, we uſually grieve at the evils of thoſe we love; and ſuch are the ſins of Believers, they are inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to themſelves, and enemies to their own ſouls: This the Spirit of God ſees that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls, by their carnal affections, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual paſſions, by their corrupt communications, and fleſhly luſts, do not onely reſiſt him, and fruſtrate his work in them; but theſe alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure and endanger their own ſouls; by theſe they loſe many a mercy, and draw upon them many afflictions and fatherly diſpleaſure from God againſt them; and this grieves the Spirit to ſee; and this removes his preſence, and hinders his comforting, quickening operations, by reaſon of which their ſpirits fail, and become cold and weak to every heavenly action, Your work Chriſtians, is to be tender of the Spirit; to take heed you be not unkind to his perſon, that you do not undervalue his gracious communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or reſiſt his internal operations: Take heed of unthankfulneſs for his kindneſſes, of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:132285:87"/> ſlighting his counſels, of unſuitable walking to his rules and mercies, if you would not grieve him, and ſo deprive your ſelves of his quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influences on your ſpirits. That's the firſt: Beware of thoſe things that weaken this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you would maintain a Heavenly Spirit; get all the nouriſhment you can for it: As the body is nouriſhed by food, and the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirits by contributions of joy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo is this Heavenly Spirit by all the means and helps God hath appointed to this end, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 6. nouriſhed up in the word of</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, If you will keep up a Heavenly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; be much in communion with the Father of Spirits. Fellowſhip with God puts a ſtamp of Heaven upon the ſoul, and leaves an impreſs of the Divine Nature on it. 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. But we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Views of God, though but through the glaſs of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, have an aſſimulating virtue, and do tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the mind into his own likeneſs. When <hi>Moſes</hi> was taken up into a nearneſs to God, he gets ſome abiding beams of his glory upon him, and comes off with divine ſhines on his countenance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 35. When the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:132285:88"/> was got on to a high Mountain apart, and had more near fellowſhip with Heaven, 'tis ſaid: He was <hi>transfigured, and his face did ſhine.</hi> Nearneſs to God does wonderfully warm and quicken the heart, as approaches of the Sun do the body. <hi>With thee is the fountain of life; in thy light ſhall we ſee light, Pſal.</hi> 36. 9. As the being of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life lies in union with-God in Chriſt by faith; ſo is its well being maintained by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in the Spirit, who ſupplies the ſoul with quickenings, as the fountain doth the veſſel that's put under it, with waters: God is in himſelf the Eſſential Life, and to his people the fountain of Life. <note n="c" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Tu Domine es vita per eſſentiam &amp; ſons vitae per communionem, a te omnis vita effluit ac inceſſanter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flait.</hi> Jo. Paul. Palant.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou Lord</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>art life by thy Eſſence, and the fountain of Life by communion; from thee all Life flows out, and runs down unceſſantly.</hi> In fellowſhip the Lord Jeſus lets out Himſelf, Love and Spirit; and this attracts the heart after God, and ſtrengthens the ſoul's motions after him. <hi>Every act of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Chriſt here</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Reyner) is a ſtep Heaven-ward:</hi> By it the heart is raiſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God, ſweetly refreſhed and ſtrengthened with ſpiritual ſtrength. <hi>To live in fellowſhip with God</hi> (ſaies the ſame Authour) <hi>is to live at the higheſt rate under Heaven, next to Heaven; yea as in a corner of Heaven, to live in the higheſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Chriſtianity,—'tis the Life of Paradiſe, an Evangelical, yea Angelical and Coeleſtial Life, in compariſon whereof the moſt men and women are dead.</hi> Communion with God does wonderfully
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:132285:88"/> nouriſh the Heavenly Spirit, and fatten the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual part of Believers: <hi>Such</hi> (ſaith <hi>Reyner) ſuck a honey-comb, eat fat things full of marrow, and drink wine on the lees well refined, ſpiced wine.</hi> O Chriſtians; preſs after nearneſs to God in Ordinances and Duties; reſt not in higheſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges without ſpiritual converſe with God in them, and communications of his Love and Life through them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Cheriſh heavenly motions in your hearts, and be tender of all the breathings of the Spirit upon you. It may be the Lord comes in upon the heart with ſome Spiritual Light or Life, in a Sermon, or in a Duty, or when alone, ſtirring up thy deſires, and warming thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, making ſome offers of grace, and help to thy dull and languiſhing ſoul; take heed now how thou ſlighteſt or ſtifleſt theſe: this is one ſtep to the quenching of the Spirit, and impeding its gracious aſſiſtance, and vital operations on thy ſoul: 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. verſ. 19. Quench not the Spirit.</hi> He that will kindle a fire, gathers up every little coal, and makes the moſt of the leaſt ſpark. The ſhavings of gold are gold, and the ſmalleſt breathings of the Spirit are to be highly prized: He that checks the firſt motions of the Spirit, may never meet with the ſecond; and he that ſlights the leaſt gifts of grace, may forever miſs of its larger doles. O to what a height might grace come in thy ſoul, if every ſtirring of it were improved! God deſpiſes not the day of thy ſmall things; how unreaſonable is it thou ſhould'ſt overlook his! The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus (Chriſtians) doth nouriſh and cheriſh the leaſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:132285:89"/> good that is in you, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 29. O be tender of whatever communications come from him to you! This will abundantly help on the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livenings and enlargements of this Heavenly Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Dwell much in the meditation of Heaven; this will heavenlize your ſpirit: 'Twas this made the Apoſtles perſons of ſuch heavenly ſpirits; they did often look to things above. 1 <hi>Cor. 4 18. While we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen.</hi> No affliction could diſcourage them from owning and profeſſing Chriſt; nor earthly comforts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure their deſires and delights from Chriſt; and that which ſo ſtrongly guarded their hearts from either of theſe dangers, was a firm perſwaſion of an intereſt in future glory, and a diligent obſerving eye upon this glory: a levelling look at this mark does wonderfully raiſe the heart towards it, and put in a new ſpirit and life into the ſoul, ſtrongly engaging all its attempts towards the enjoyment of it: Frequent contemplations of Heaven do much wean the heart from this Earth. If thou remembreſt thou art not of this world, earthly things ſhall onely be admitted into the Court of the Temple, not into the heart, which is the Holy of Holies, <hi>Burg.</hi> on 17. <hi>Joh.</hi> How contemptibly did thoſe Worthies of old look on this world, when once they got ſights of Heaven! <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. They counted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtrangers and pilgrims on the Earth; were not mindful of their own Country; went out from it; would no more return to it; ſought
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:132285:89"/> an heavenly Countrey; were perſwaded of thoſe great and glorious things above, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them; laid hold of them by faith; and made after them: and that which did ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully work over their ſpirits to theſe things above, was their believing ſights of them. <hi>V. 13. Theſe all died in the faith, not having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the promiſes, but having ſeen them afar off;</hi> that is, <hi>the things promiſed, (viz.) heavenly things,</hi> of which <hi>Canaan</hi> was a type. So <note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Tria participia refero ad promiſſionis rem ſignificatam Patriam Coeleſtem quam unice deſiderabant.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi> refers the participles here to the things ſignified of the promiſe, that heavenly Country which they onely deſired. <hi>Things neareſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>take leaſt care of the Earth: The Fowls of the Air neither plow nor ſow.</hi> The glory of the world ſeems little to one that dwells much on the believing views of Heaven. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Fulgentius, That when he beheld the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and joy of</hi> Rome, <hi>the glory of the</hi> Roman <hi>Nobility, the triumphant pomp of King</hi> Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, <hi>he was ſo far from being taken with it, that it raiſed up his deſires after heavenly joys the more, ſaying, How beautiful may the Coeleſtial</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>be, when terreſtrial</hi> Rome <hi>ſo glittereth! If ſuch honour be given to lovers of vanity, what glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhall be imparted to the Saints, who are lovers and followers of truth!</hi> Serious thoughts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will inflame the deſires after it: <hi>Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in Heaven</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) whence alſo we look for the Saviour, who ſhall change our vile bodies into the likeneſs of his glorious body, Phil.</hi> 3. 20. We wait, hope for, and expect Heaven,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:132285:90"/> to be where this bleſſed Countrey is; the breadth and length of which we now look into by faith. If your thoughts be much on Heaven, your long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will be much for Heaven. I have read of one being in his journey towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> thought he ſaw famous Cities in his way, and met with many friendly entertainments; yet would often ſay, <hi>I muſt not ſtay here; this is not</hi> Jeruſalem: So will thy heart ſay (if thou converſeſt much in Heaven now) when thou meeteſt with the moſt deſirable comforts of this life; yet this is not Heaven; my affections muſt not ſtay here. Allow time every day to take ſome turns in the upper world, and to get thy heart held in the galleries above; where are the ſweeteſt delicacies, and moſt delighting views to take thy heart, and ſublimate thy affections to theſe pure and eternal things?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If you would keep up a Heavenly Spirit; be much exerciſed in heavenly actions: As is mens employments they are moſtly verſed about, ſo uſually is their ſpirit: Actions ſtrengthen habits: Men that are much taken up about earthly things, are earthly-minded; their ſpirits being tinctured with the things they have much to do with: Such are heavenly actions to gracious ſouls; they draw forth and exerciſe their graces: uſe makes men ready, and adapts their ſpirits to their work. The Apoſtle makes this an evidence of ſtrength in grace, that ſuch are much in the exerciſe of it. <hi>Heb. 5. 14. Strong meat belongeth to them who are of full age; even thoſe who by reaſon of uſe have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:132285:90"/> evil.</hi> The more you are converſant about holy things, the ſtronger will be the bent of your ſpirit to them; the more facile and pleaſant will Religion be, and the indiſpoſition of your ſpirit to it more abated. <hi>Prov. 10. 29. The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright.</hi> The more you walk in it, the leſs weary will you be; the more pleaſure will you find in it, and the more propenſe will your ſpirit be to it. This is the firſt work in Wiſdom's Merchandiſe; to get and keep up a Heavenly Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another piece of your Heavenly Trade is, to ſecure your intereſt in heavenly things. This is part of mens buſineſs in the world, to ſecure their intereſt in the things they have: they mark their goods, and brand their cattel, and ſet their names on the things they have, that their intereſt in them might be known: And this is the great concern of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's Merchants alſo, to make good their claim to, and prove their propriety in the things of Heaven and Glory: Theſe are worth the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, being things of infinite moment, and eternal duration; other things are not. O what folly is it to ſtrive for ſhadows, and loſe the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; to get and ſecure Houſes, Lands, and Reputation for your Children, and to loſe your ſouls! As he that complained when he was to dye; <hi>That he muſt burn in Hell for ever, for get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eſtate for his Son, and neglecting his own ſoul. What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul? Matth.</hi> 16. 24. To make all things elſe ſure, and leave God, Grace and Glory to an uncertainty. As <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:132285:91"/> bewail'd when too late, ſaying when he was near death; <hi>I have endeavoured to ſecure me againſt every danger but death; and having never thought of death, muſt now dye.</hi> Things eternal will then appear the greateſt when men come to dye; then an intereſt in God, pardon and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will be valued beyond ten thouſand worlds: And is it not worth the looking after now?</p>
                  <p>And what can compenſate the loſs of that ſoul, who miſcarries in his All, and hath nothing left but the tormenting ſenſe of what he hath loſt, and the intolerable burden of what he hath found, as the fruit of his often cautioned folly? 'Tis a dreadful thing to be diſappointed of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation-hopes: What if thou ſhould'ſt miſs of glory at laſt, and thy end ſhould be to be cut off, and to have thy portion with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in that Lake which burns with fire and brimſtone, where the worm never dieth, and the fire is never quenched? <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 44. How could'ſt thou bear, if when thou thinkeſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the joy of the Lord, then in a moment to be thruſt into the place of torment? and when thou dreameſt of carrying up into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s boſome, where is eternal pleaſures; to fall into the hands of God, who is a conſuming fire? this is fearful.</p>
                  <p>And yet this may be thy caſe. Think how poſſible, nay how eaſy 'tis for men to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in leſſer matters, and that they who have had the higheſt confidences of a future bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, have been miſtaken at laſt, and all their hopes have expir'd as a falling Meteor, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:132285:91"/> come to nothing, <hi>Job 27. 8. For what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained much, when God taketh away his ſoul?</hi> Men may think themſelves to be ſomething, and yet be nothing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 2. Come with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to the Bridegroom's doors, and demand an entrance as the fooliſh Virgins did, and yet rejected. <hi>Mat. 25. 11, 12. Afterward came alſo the other Virgins,</hi> (that is when the door was ſhut) <hi>ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us; but he anſwered and ſaid; verily I ſay unto you, I know you not.</hi> They may ſeem to have ſome reaſon for their claim, and produce evidences of their hope, and yet be turned away as workers of iniquity. <hi>Mat. 7. 22, 23. Lord, have we not propheſied in thy name? have caſt out Devils? and in thy name have done many wonderful works? And then will I profeſs to them, I never knew you, depart from me ye workers of iniquity:</hi> The heart is deep and deceitful, who can know it? none but he who ſearcheth the deep things of God can reach this bottom, and bring to light the hidden things thereof: The work of grace is a ſecret full of myſteries, that none can open and fully know, but the eternal Spirit that formed it in the womb of a Believer's heart: Seeming grace hath ſo near a reſemblance to ſaving grace, that it puzzles the moſt curious and ſearching eye (if not enlighten'd with a beam from Heaven) to diſcern the difference: beſides, the ſlender meaſures of the Spirit that moſt have attained to in this life, with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til inſinuations, the falſe repreſentations, and treacherous prevarications of that bloody and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:132285:92"/> irreconcilable enemy of mankind, all which conſpire to put a cheat upon the profeſſing Chriſtian, and render his Salvation exceeding doubtful. And ſuppoſe thy ſtate ſhould be ſafe, yet how perplexing and full of anxiety is it, to have the leaſt ſuſpition of thy unſoundneſs? To have the life of thy precious ſoul hang in ſuſpence, and to be unreſolv'd in that great caſe, whether thou muſt live or die to all eternity! O! how tormenting and heart-ſinking is this! An awakened Soul that cannot reſt in ſin, nor yet hope in grace, or upon any Scripture-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant come to a determination about his real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, and things eternal, is like a troubled Sea that cannot reſt; Inſtruments of Muſick cannot allay its diſquietude, no Creature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts can charm its heart to a peaceful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure: who does in reallity but ſuſpect his eternal welfare, and but think he reads this hand-writing on the wall: <hi>Mene, mene, tekel upharſin: Thou art weighed in the balance, and art found wanting, Dan.</hi> 5. 25. 27. Nothing in all the World can be a Plaiſter broad enough for ſuch a wound, no Cordial can cheer that heart, till Grace decides the controverſy, and aſſures the Soul of an unqueſtionable title to the Heir of all things, and to the inheritance with the Saints in light: And have you not reaſon then to be reſtleſs till your propriety in theſe glorious treaſures be atteſted; which, though difficult, yet is poſſible and feaſible to all that follow Wiſdom's counſel in order to it? The eternal truth hath opened a way to the deciſion of this queſtion, whether I have eternal life or no, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:132285:92"/> laid down certain marks of a Soul entitled to things above. 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 13. Theſe things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life; Verſ. 12. 19. Chap.</hi> 3. 14. The Lord hath charged this to be the duty of all that profeſs their hopes of glory, to make their Calling and Election ſure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themſelves whether they be in the Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. To prove their own work, that they may have rejoycing in themſelves, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4. which he would never have done were it impoſſible: He hath alſo promiſed the Spirit to help them in this work, and to lead them into all truth, bearing witneſs with their ſpirits that they are the Lords, <hi>Joh. 16. 13. Rom.</hi> 8. 16. And upon this very account exhorts them to holineſs, that they might not impede this ſealing work of the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. And upon the arrival to this certainty, hath enſured great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and advantage, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. 10, 11. All which words ſignify nothing, and reflect unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs on the ſpirit of truth, were not an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of right to theſe heavenly things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how may I come to the knowledg of this deſirable truth; that Heavenly Treaſures are ſurely mine, and that I may make a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable claim to God, to Chriſt, and theſe things of the other World?</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Firſt, By your conjugal union with the Heir of Heaven: All things in Heaven and

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:132285:93"/> way of poſſeſſion, as an owner and proprietor: If you have Chriſt, you have all that is his, his perſon and purchaſe go together: <hi>Rebekah</hi> muſt conſent to go and marry <hi>Iſaac</hi> before ſhe could be inveſted with that ſubſtance and wealth which was his. This new covenant which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts a ſoul in the Lord Jeſus, and his unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches, is a marriage-covenant. <hi>Hoſ. 2. 19, 20. And I will betroth thee unto me for ever, yea I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judgment, and in loving-kindneſs, and in mercies; I will even betroth thee to me in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi> Ezek. 16. 8. <hi>I entred into covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord, and thou becameſt mine;</hi> this was a marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenant. <hi>Jer. 3. 14. Turn O back ſliding chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſaith the Lord, for I am married to you.</hi> If you would ſee your title to heavenly treaſures, try your conjugal union to the Lord Jeſus the Heir of Heaven. Every relation to Chriſt is not a conjugal relation. There is a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as dead branches to the tree: <hi>Joh. 15. 2. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away.</hi> A perſon may be in Chriſt as the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant branch or ſucker is in the tree, that ſucks the ſap of priviledges, and gets ſome nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of frames, and comforts, but brings not forth fruit, it ſprouts out of the ſtock, as proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleſh grows on the wound, but hath no right union with the root, or nouriſhment from the head: Such are obtruders and hang-bies, which take the place of children, but are ſtrangers, who climb up as the thief to ſteal, but comes not in by the door to dwell with God: they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:132285:94"/> are retainers to Chriſt's Houſe, that now and then do ſome ſervice for him, and have ſome ſcraps and favours, but are no abiding members of his houſe; like the Apricot, that leans on the wall, but is rooted in the earth.</p>
                  <p>There is a temporary Relation alſo; as of a Servant to a Maſter, where there is a propriety for a time: The ſervant comes into the houſe, enjoys priviledges and protection, and doth ſome ſervice, is very uſeful for the family, and it may be beloved too: (as a ſervant.) And ſuch is the relation of ſome to Chriſt; but this differs vaſtly from that union which entitles to the perſon and purchaſe of the Lord Jeſus; he is merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in all he doth, and hath by-ends in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and continuance; he does not any thing from pure love to Chriſt, but for ſelf-reſpects and advantage: his welfare is not wrapt up in the welfare of the family, to ſtand or fall with it; to embark his All in the proſperity of that houſe: he lives in the family, and upon his Lord, but to himſelf, and is as the Planets which are carried about with the <hi>primum mobile;</hi> but yet have a diſtinct motion and courſe of their own: he is in the family, but not of the family; and as his relation is but titular, ſo his ſtation is but temporary; he abides not in the houſe for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 35. And when he goes away he carries off nothing but his own; not a jot of the inheritance is his; he hath fared well, and had a great deal of credit and comfort for a time; but goes as he came, and is the ſame perſon as he was.</p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:132285:94"/>
                  <p>There is alſo a Concubine-Relation to Chriſt, which gives the ſoul ſome uſe of his kindneſs, but no right to his perſon. <note n="b" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Concubina a: concubo.</hi> Beza de repud. &amp; divort. p. 249.</note> 
                     <hi>A Concubine is one that is contented with ones bed, but hath no conjugal love to his perſon; neither doth ſhe paſs into the husband's family, or are her children counted legitimate:</hi> She is one that either by conſtraint or conſent, comes over into an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal communion with another for his uſe and bed; but is never married to his perſon, or hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen him for her husband, to become one fleſh with him, to take up her delight in him, and to do all from a principle of love to him: And as ſhe hath not the properties; ſo ſhe hath not the priviledges of a wife, for intimacy and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in reſpect of power and maintenance. Such is the relation that many have to Chriſt; they conſent to have ſome enjoyment of Chriſt, but have no marriage-union with him; he is not theirs by choice, but either for neceſſity or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to enjoy their own pleaſures by him, and receive ſome profit from him: they never ſaw an excellency in him, or were ever unheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, as he is by his Spouſe. <hi>Cant. 4. 9.

And as they are
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:132285:95"/> ſtrangers to an eſpouſal-ſtate; ſo are they to a Spouſe-like diſpoſition; they have not the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and carriage of a wife, nor the priviledges that ſuch uſe to have; they are not acquainted with his ſecrets, nor the openings of his heart, and thoſe amorous embracements peculiar to ſuch a relation; they are not inveſted with any Authority or Rule; they have no power over their corruptions, nor command of their ſpirits and affections, that ſhould be in ſubjection to them: Grace bears no ſway in them; ſin and ſelf does all in their ſouls; neither were they ever enrolled in his family, or owned by the Lord Jeſus as his <hi>Hephzibah</hi>'s, nor have the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance and ſpecial proviſions of the King's Bride, and Lamb's Wife; and as to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and thoſe births they ſeem to have by Jeſus Chriſt, they are ſpurious and illegitimate, and never owned by the Lord Jeſus as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine products of his own Spirit. This is the caſe of thoſe that have not marriage-union with Chriſt; they have no right to him or his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Try then your Eſpouſal-relation to Chriſt.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may I know whether I am married to Chriſt or no?</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Firſt, If you are married to Chriſt, you are ſuch as have ſpecial acquaintance with Chriſt; you know him as none elſe do. The wife hath the moſt peculiar and diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her husband of any: Others may know ſomething, yea much of him; but none
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:132285:95"/> knows him ſo much as the wife; ſhe hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with all his excellencies, and all his infirmities; ſhe has the largeſt taſts of his love, and experience of his ſweetneſs, and intimate converſes with him of any in the world. So 'tis with the Spouſe of Chriſt; ſhe dwells in his preſence, and lodges in his arms; ſhe ſees him within the veil uncloath'd of thoſe coverings that ſtand between him and the eyes of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and conceals his amiableneſs from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon beholders: He puts aſide his glorious Robe, and ſhews her his naked breaſt, and layes her hand upon his tender heart: ſhe is much alone with him in his chambers, where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes intimacy with her, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah,</hi> and diſcloſes the ſecrets of his heart, and the greateſt unveilings of his love: He tells her what thoughts he had upon her from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; when he was in his Father's Kingdom, his heart was working after her, and he thought the time long till he came down to ſee her; and no ſooner did he caſt his eye upon her (though then ſhe lay polluted in her blood, and caſt out into the field, to the loathing of her perſon) but his heart did burn within him towards her; and it was the time of love: He tells her all the time of his hard labour in the world for her, ſeem'd but a few daies; and the unſupportable burden of her ſins, and the Father's wrath upon him for her ſake, ſeem'd but as nothing for the love he bore unto her. In theſe converſes he aſſures her of his Love, Perſon and Kingdom; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may ſeem in his carriages, yet his heart is fixt upon, and faithful to her, and ſwears he
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:132285:96"/> will never, never leave her, but after a little abſence come and receive her to himſelf, and ſhe ſhall be for ever with him. Thus he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts himſelf to her, as he doth not to the world; by reaſon of which ſhe becomes ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, and knows his voice, and by faith ſees his ſheep; ſhe can tell by experience who, and what her Beloved is, and how far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than other Beloveds. There's never a ſoul that's married to Chriſt, but hath his time, when he makes out ſome ſpecial diſcoveries of his love and ſelf to it; and it can tell ſome ſtories of what Chriſt did once ſay and do unto her: what ſlights ſhe hath had of him, and gifts from him: ſuch a ſoul can tell, how when he was dead, Chriſt quickened him; when he was loſt, Chriſt found him; when he was in priſon, Chriſt ſet him free; he waſhed him when in his blood, and poured in Oyl into his wounds; healed his backſlidings, and loved him freely: He can ſay with <hi>Rebekah</hi> to her Brother <hi>Laban; Thus the man ſpake to me, and ſhewed the ear-rings and the bracelets, Gen.</hi> 24. 30. And with <hi>Judah</hi> brings forth the ſignet, bracelets and ſtaff, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 25. and tells with the blind man how Chriſt opened his eyes, and what he ſaid to him, <hi>Joh. cap. 9. ver.</hi> 15, 35, 37. And though by his ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief he may loſe the ſight of him for a time, and be under a ſuſpenſe of his diſcover'd kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet if the Believer would be true to his experience, he can diſcover ſuch an acquaintance with Chriſt as no Hypocrite ever had.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Secondly, Another thing that will prove your marriage to Chriſt, is your conjugal-love
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:132285:96"/> to him. <hi>Jer. 2. 2. I remember thee, the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy youth, the love of thy eſpouſals, when thou wenteſt after me in the wilderneſs in a Land not ſown.</hi> The Lord convinceth <hi>Iſrael</hi> of the great decay and change of their Love to what it once was; there was a time when their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were high towards God, when he call'd them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> took them from the Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnace, and married them to himſelf; then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was too hard for them; they could follow God in a wilderneſs, where there was nothing but God alone to ſatisfie them; creatures were wanting to allure them, and yet they could ſtick at nothing; no difficulties ſhould part God and them: Whence came this warmth of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? why it was their neerneſs to God that created them: The Lord had taken them into a marriage covenant, and carried them in his boſome; and this inflamed their hearts after him. When the Lord brings a ſoul into an eſpouſal-ſtate, he gives them eſpouſal-love; and that is the greateſt love: O ſweet! ſaith <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford,</hi> were that ſickneſs to be ſoul-ſick for him; and a living death it were to die in the fire of the love of that Soul-lover Jeſus. The Apoſtle makes this an eſſential duty of a married ſtate, to have conjugal affections: The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to love his Wife as his own fleſh, and the Wife to love her own Husband as her ſelf, <hi>Eph. 5. 28. Tit.</hi> 2. 4. And the Prophet reckons this love to God as the certain fruit of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-relation to him. <hi>Iſa. 56. 6. That joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Lord, to ſerve him, and to love the Name of the Lord.</hi> As ſoon as <hi>Paul</hi> had eſpouſed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:132285:97"/> the Lord Jeſus, it appeared in his ſupreme love to him; he valued none like Chriſt: <hi>He counted all things droſs and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt his Lord, Phil. 3. 8. To be found in him, not having his own righteouſneſs, v. 9. To know him, and the power of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his death, v.</hi> 10. Conjugal love is a perſonal love; pure love to Chriſt is ſet on Chriſt himſelf for himſelf, not for his gifts that come from him; but for thoſe excellencies that reſide in him; 'tis love to his perſon, not to his patrimony onely; 'tis love ſpringing from his love. 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 19. We love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> True affections to the Lord Jeſus are the births of his own love to us, a coal kindled from his fire.</p>
                  <p>Conjugal love is alſo peculiar as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal love; ſo far as 'tis conjugal, 'tis to him, and none but him; or if to others, 'tis for his ſake: Eſpouſal love to Chriſt affects none like him: If there be any perſon or thing thou loveſt more than Chriſt, or equal with him, thy affections to him are whoriſh, not conjugal: <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me: He that loveth Son or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more than me, is not worthy of me, Mat.</hi> 10. 37. Yea, he that doth not hate Father or Mother, or any thing, ſo far as it is inconſiſtent with love to Chriſt, cannot be his Diſciple, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. True love to Chriſt will let none in all the world ſhare in that love which Chriſt hath; 'twill take none into his bed but himſelf; 'tis chaſte love.</p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:132285:97"/>
                  <p>Again, Conjugal-love is not onely to Chriſt, but 'tis ſuch a love as longs to be <hi>found in Chriſt, not in himſelf;</hi> it would have all his glory and excellency in Chriſt; it reckons Chriſt for all that's truly honourable as to him; it would get as near to Chriſt as poſſible; yea it never reſts till in him: <hi>To be found in him.</hi> 'Tis alſo ſuch a love as conforms to Chriſt: Love is of an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilating ſpirit; it would be like to its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar object. The affectionate wife conforms as much as may be to her Husband: ſo 'tis with the Spouſe of Chriſt, ſhe would in every thing that is imitable reſemble him, and 'tis her great trouble ſhe is not more like him: what would ſuch a ſoul give if his heart was like Chriſt's heart; if he had ſuch a ſpirit and life as the Lord Jeſus had on Earth? it would be holy as Chriſt is holy, and cannot ſet up a ſtand ſhort of that: 'Tis true, the ſoul hath not ſuch a ſpirit as Chriſt had; 'tis too proud, vain, carnal paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, earthly, ſelfiſh, and that troubles him; but it can never be quiet, till he comes nearer to the pattern in Heaven, and to a full reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of his well-beloved Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Thirdly, A ſoul eſpouſed to Chriſt will leave all for Chriſt; that's the condition of marriage between Chriſt and his Bride. <hi>Pſal. 45. v. 10, 11. Hearken O Daughter and conſider, and incline thine ear; forget alſo thine own people, and thy Father's houſe, ſo ſhall the King greatly deſire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord, and worſhip thou him:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, weigh and conſider the terms on which this match is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between Chriſt and you. If you will
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:132285:98"/> be his, you muſt leave all for him; you muſt forſake all your other lovers, friends, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, comforts for Chriſt, ſo far as theſe hinder your love to Chriſt, your communion with, and ſerviceableneſs unto him. When the woman comes to be married, ſhe leaves her friends, Father's houſe, Countrey, and all to come and live with him that ſhall be her Husband. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah</hi> left her Father, Brother, Friends and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to go to <hi>Iſaac, Gen. 24. 58. And they called Rebekah, and ſaid unto her, wilt thou go with this man? and ſhe ſaid I will go.</hi> That ſoul that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſent really and conſiderately to part with all for Chriſt, never yet came up to marriage-terms: The treaty between Chriſt and that ſoul never went far enough for a concluſion; and if it go no farther; if thy ſoul cannot ſeal to this, to part with all thy intereſts, thy deareſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; yea thy ſelf for Chriſt, the match muſt after all be broken, and Chriſt and thee part at laſt, yea part for ever. O ſoul! try thy heart in this; here lies the knot, the vertical point; this is the moſt difficult of all Chriſt's propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, and that the ſoul is longeſt conſenting to, even the letting go all for Chriſt: His perſon may pleaſe well enough; his eſtate is deſirable for a reverſion; but now to take leave of, and to go with Chriſt, this is the <hi>hard ſaying:</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would have Chriſt and the world too, Chriſt and friends too, Chriſt and reputation, peace, liberty, pleaſure, and ſelf too; and if this will not be granted, break the bargain: but if ever Chriſt and you have cloſed, and you are his, and he yours, you cannot count any thing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:132285:98"/> too dear to part with for him, or to let go at his bidding: If Chriſt calls for Eſtate, Husband; Wife, Children, an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a <hi>Benjamin,</hi> a right Eye, a right Hand, all muſt go; and you muſt part with them freely and chearfully, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did with <hi>Iſaac. Gen. 22. 3. Abraham roſe up early in the morning, and ſadled his Aſſes, and took two of his young men with him, and Iſaac his Son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and went unto the place of which God had told him:</hi> Not as <hi>Jacob</hi> did part with <hi>Benjamin;</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and grudgingly, <hi>Gen. 43. 11. If it muſt be ſo now, do this, &amp;c.</hi> He was almoſt ſtarv'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would conſent to part with <hi>Benjamin;</hi> and when he did, het lets him go laſt of all: he parts with <hi>the beſt fruits of the Land, Balm, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Spices, Myrrh, Nuts, Almonds, double mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> any thing firſt; at laſt <hi>Benjamin</hi> was ſcrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out too: Many muſt have their comforts wrench'd out of their hands before they will let them go; but this is not love to Chriſt. A ſoul married to Chriſt will ſay with <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth</hi> concerning his Land; <hi>Let Zibah take all; for as much as my Lord the King is come again in peace to his own houſe, 2 Sam.</hi> 19. 30. So, let God take all my eſtate, ſtrength, liberty, comforts, ſeeing the Lord Jeſus is come home to my ſoul in peace: Houſes, Lands, Friends, Credit, Peace, Life, may be dear, but Chriſt will be dearer if he and you are one fleſh. <hi>All Bavaria</hi> (ſaid <hi>George Carpenter) is not ſo dear to me as my Wife and Children; yet for Chriſt's ſake I will forſake them chearfully. Do you think me ſuch a fool</hi> (ſaid <hi>Ogvier</hi> to one that tempted him with
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:132285:99"/> life and preferment) <hi>that I ſhould change eternal things for temporal. Loſs of goods is great;</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hooper) but loſs of God's grace and favour is greater?</hi> Love is never throughly ſeen till it comes to parting: O the tuggings, holdings, ſhifts and reaſonings that men will have before they will part with that they dearly love: <hi>Now it will appear</hi> (ſaith <hi>Philpot) what we love beſt, for to that we love we will ſtick:</hi> If Chriſt have moſt of your hearts, you will let fall every thing out of your hands to hold faſt Chriſt: <hi>I have</hi> (ſaid Mr. <hi>Bale) exil'd my ſelf for ever from mine own native Countrey, Kindred, Friends, Acquaintance, which are the great delights of this life, and am well contented for the ſake of Chriſt..</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. Fourthly, A Soul married to Chriſt, ſtays, and lives on Chriſt. The Wife caſts her ſelf upon her Husband's love and care for her ſupplies, and lives on his allowance for all her proviſions: 'tis ſuſpitious for a married Woman to be maintain'd by ſtrangers, and to live on other men for what ſhe needs; 'tis the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's duty to provide for his own, and to nouriſh and cheriſh his Wife as the Lord the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 29. and 'tis the Wives duty to go to and rely on his faithfulneſs for it: So 'tis with the Soul that hath eſpouſed Chriſt; it is to live on Chriſt for all it needs: they that take Chriſt aright, take him for their All, not for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or worſe for richer or poorer, as Women take their earthly Husbands, (for Chriſt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beſt of all, always exceeding rich, and full of unſearchable treaſures,) but to take him for
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:132285:99"/> their only and ſufficient portion at all times, and in all eſtates. <hi>Lam. 3. 24. The Lord is my portion, ſaith my Soul, therefore will I truſt in him. Lord,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Paulinus,</hi> when his City, Gold and Silver was taken away) <hi>let not the loſs of theſe things trouble me; for thou art all, and more than all theſe to me; [Shaw</hi>'s Tombſtone, p. 33.] Chriſt is the Believer's All in the way, and God his All in All at the end. <hi>It hath pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him all things ſhould be put, 2 Col. 1. 19. Heb.</hi> 2. 8. And this is for the ſupply, comfort and bleſſedneſs of thoſe that are his. <hi>Eph. 1. 23. Which is the body, the fulneſs of him who filleth all in all.</hi> Whatever Chriſt hath (as Mediator) is the Churches for her uſe and profit: If men have plenty of liquors, they fill their veſſels with them; if they have much riches, they place them in their treaſury, ſo doth Chriſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his fulneſs for his Churches good; hence 'tis the Spouſe of Chriſt comes leaning on her Beloved from the Wilderneſs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 5. and dares adventure her All on the love and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of her loving and lovely Lord; ſhe is full of failings, but ſhe lives on him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; many are her weakneſſes, but ſhe goes to Chriſt for ſtrength. <hi>Iſa. 45. 24. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength:</hi> She is ſenſible of many wants, but caſts her ſelf on the promiſe; <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your wants, Phil.</hi> 4. 19. Her back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings, temptations, dangers, troubles and fears are many, but ſhe ſtays on the Lord Jeſus, whom ſhe hath choſen for her only friend in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:132285:100"/> Heaven and Earth, and there ſhe lays her ſelf down in his boſome, when wearied with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and doubts, and embarques her ſelf in his faithfulneſs for all ſhe ſtands in need of, for life and godlineſs, for grace and glory.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 5. Fifthly, Fruitfulneſs to Chriſt proves Marriage to Chriſt: Hence the Spouſe is ſet forth by metaphors that expreſs fruitfulneſs; a <hi>Garden,</hi> not a wilderneſs; a <hi>well watered Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> which is uſually moſt fruitful, where the Spices flow out, where the Graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are more operative and abundant, and Souls become more fruitful in manifeſted holineſs; <hi>An Orchard planted with choice and pleaſant fruits, Camphire, Spikenard, Saffron, Calamus, Cinamon, with all trees of Frankincenſe, Myrh and Aloes,</hi> with all the chiefeſt Spices, which ſignify the preciouſneſs, variety and abundance of grace and holineſs in thoſe who are ſavingly united to the Lord Jeſus: <hi>A flock of Sheep, whereof every one beareth twins, and not one is barren, Cant. 4. 12, 13, 14, 16. Ch.</hi> 4. 2. 'Tis compared to the <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> the <hi>Cedar,</hi> the <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> a green <hi>Olive,</hi> plants famous for flouriſhing, growth, cluſters of fruit, conſtant fruitfulneſs; 'tis ſaid of the Fig-tree, it bears fruit all the year long, and in many places they ſhall always find green figs on it: Such is the Spouſe of Chriſt, compared with the world and hypocrites fruitful and flouriſhing: <hi>A good tree bringeth forth good fruit,</hi> Mat. 7. 17. <hi>The root of the righteous yieldeth fruit, Prov.</hi> 12. 12. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the grace of God is received in truth, there it brings forth fruit, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 6. As ſin brings
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:132285:100"/> forth fruit unto death, ſo doth grace unto life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. No ſooner doth the Lord Jeſus eſpouſe a Soul, but he heals it of its barrenneſs: <hi>He maketh the barren Woman to keep houſe,</hi> Pſal. 113. 9. <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away, Joh.</hi> 15. 2. A barren Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is a monſter in Religion, no living member of Chriſt's body; indeed there are Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſons when fruit may not appear, but even then 'tis in the ſeed and ſap; and there is a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for fruit, which appears in the ſeaſon, but to be always without the fruits of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22, 23. is a ſign of one that never had marriage-union, and intimate communion with Jeſus Chriſt, but is the certain mark of a fruitleſs Fig-tree, in danger of cutting down, and the character of that ground which is curſed, and nigh to burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Luke 13. 7. 9. Heb.</hi> 6. 8. Souls, try your ſtate, 'tis for your lives, your All depends upon your marriage-union with Chriſt: Had you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any ſpecial acquaintance with Chriſt? Have you no conjugal love to Chriſt? Cannot you conſent to leave all for Chriſt? Do you uſually live and ſtay on other things for life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not on Chriſt? Have you been ever barren ſouls, that never brought forth the fruits of the Spirit unto God? then were you never married to Chriſt, nor have any true title to heavenly treaſures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mark</hi> 2. Secondly, your intereſt in heavenly things is known by the naturalneſs and ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of your love to them; <hi>Where the treaſure
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:132285:101"/> is, there will the heart be, Mat.</hi> 6. 21. If hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things be yours, your heart is there; worldly men have the <hi>World ſet in their hearts, Eccl.</hi> 3. 11. Their heart is but the <hi>World copied out:</hi> ſo heavenly ſouls have Heaven ſet in their hearts, which are but the counterpane of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; every thing hath a natural love to his own, the World will love his own. <hi>Joh. 15. 19. No man ever hated his own fleſh: Eph.</hi> 5. 29. What affections have brute beaſts for their young, and will venture their lives to defend and maintain them. 'Tis ſtoried of the Storks, when the Town of <hi>Delph</hi> in the low Countreys was on fire, and the Storks perceived the fire to come near their neſts, they endeavoured to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away their young, but when they could not remove them, they flutter'd over them with their wings, covering them from the flames till they all periſhed together, [<hi>Belg. Com. wealth.</hi>] So ſtrong is natural affection to its intereſt, and the natural iſſues of it ſelf; much ſtronger ſhould gracious affections be to their intereſts: <hi>O how I love thy Law!</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) 'tis my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation all the day long, Pſal.</hi> 119. 97. Whence came this affection? it was from his intereſt in thoſe great and lovely truths. <hi>Pſal. 119. 111. Thy teſtimonies have I choſen as an heritage for ever, for they are the rejoycing of my heart.</hi> Souls riſen with Chriſt, and born to the inheritance above, will ſet their affections on things above, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. Where is thy heart, Chriſtian, in Heaven or Earth? what things are deareſt to thee, and ſweeteſt to thy taſte? canſt thou prize the light of God's countenance better
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:132285:101"/> than life? had'ſt thou rather be a door-keeper in God's Houſe than dwell in the Pavilions of this World? Is a little of Heaven better than a great deal of Earth? and can thy heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be at any loſs in the World to enjoy God in his Ordinances, and to be enriched with ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places? Then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things are thine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mark</hi> 3. Thirdly, if heavenly things be yours, it will appear by your heart-cares for them, and vigorous purſuits of them; how careful are men of their intereſts, to ſecure and enlarge them? <hi>Phil. 2. 21. All men ſeek their own:</hi> If the things of Heaven be yours, your greateſt care will be to get and keep them; when <hi>Kiſh</hi> thought his Son <hi>Saul</hi> was loſt, he left caring for the <hi>Aſſes,</hi> ſorrowing for him, ſaying, <hi>What ſhall I do for my Son, 1 Sam.</hi> 10. 2? Chriſtians, if heavenly things be yours, they will lie nearer your hearts than all the World beſides; the ſenſe or fear of loſing them will more trouble you than all loſſes beſides; the world, relations, creature-comforts will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; when you apprehend a death on your heavenly intereſts, you will do more, and part with more to get Heaven, than the World and deareſt comforts of it. Many will pretend de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for Heaven, as the young man in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; but Chriſt will ſay to them as to his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Mat. 5. 47. What do you more than others?</hi> Souls, you would have Chriſt here, and Heaven hereafter; but what do you for it? what do you more than hypocrites and common profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, whoſe portion is in this life? can you leave
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:132285:102"/> the world for God? can you deny your ſelf for the pleaſing of Chriſt? and part with your right eye, and right hand; throw away your Idols of gold and ſilver, the world, and fleſhly luſts, and honour God with your time, ſtrength and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? Can you let your Plough ſtand ſtill to follow God's; and ſtick at no pains and hardſhips to enjoy the leaſt ſpiritual good? Then are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things yours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mark</hi> 4. Fourthly, Then are you intereſted in Heavenly Treaſures, when your hearts and ſpirits are ſuited to them; when the Lord hath let in a heavenly tincture on your hearts; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid your ſpirits with heavenlineſs, and a mind that anſwers to heavenly things, as face an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers face in the water: When God intends men for Heaven, he doth in time fit them for it; and where he gives a title to mercy, he gives a capacity alſo; where he makes over the riches of glory; he makes that ſoul a veſſel fit for glory. Men do not purchaſe Pearls for Swine, and build Schools for brute beaſts. God did not make the Heavens for fiſhes, and the Sea for beaſts, but ſuited every creature to its element: They that are his Adoption, are his new Creation alſo, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 10. and when they are deſigned to a bleſſed end, they are principled for it, and have a diſpoſition put into them to move towards it: They that are ſet apart for Heaven hereafter, do bear the image of their heavenly Father here, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 49. There is a ſtamp of glory upon the Heirs of glory, though it may be ſo covered with dirt, and worn out with the ruſt of corruption, as not to be eaſily
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:132285:102"/> ſeen at all times. <hi>Whoſe is this image and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription? Matt. 22. 20. Caeſar</hi>'s coin hath <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ſtamp; and the Children of Heaven have their Father's mark upon their foreheads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1. If Chriſt's Treaſures be yours, you are his Treaſury; though earthen veſſels, yet treaſures, veſſels and bags that wax not old. Do you hope for ſpiritual bleſſings? what manner of ſpirits are you of? Do you ſavour heavenly things? What things do beſt ſuit and pleaſe your ſpirits, the things of Heaven, or the things of the world; grace, or goods; righteouſneſs, or riches; ſpiritual things, or carnal? What goes down eaſieſt, or when down, ſits eaſieſt on your ſtomacks? The Heirs of Heaven are Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts to this world, but transformed into the Spirit of Heaven, and the renewing of their minds to their new eſtate, bleſſedneſs and glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. That's a ſecond thing wherein this Heavenly Trade lies, in ſecuring and clearing up your intereſt in heavenly things.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another thing wherein this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Trade lies is this; in getting in of heavenly goods: This is a great part of Traders buſineſs, to be furniſhing themſelves with wares fit for their employmeat and advantage; the Artificer in making; the Merchant in buying in goods that are vendible and will turn to profit. So muſt Wiſdom's Merchants get themſelves ſtor'd with Wiſdom's wares, that they may be able to drive on her Trade: Onely in this lies the difference; earthly goods are either the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of mens labours, and effects of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; or elſe the purchaſe of their money
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:132285:103"/> and treaſures: But heavenly goods come not in this way, as the proportionable reward of their labours, or return of their money: Indeed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bread muſt be laboured for; but when all is done, the Son of man gives it to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. Salvation muſt be wrought out, as if it lay at their fingers end; and yet this very will and power to work wrought in them. <hi>Phil. 2. 12, 13. Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> No ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is found in the creature, before ſaving grace helps, to embrace its overtures, no more than a dead body to receive life. <hi>Epheſ. 2. 1. You have not choſen me, but I have choſen you, and ordained you, that you ſhould go and bring forth fruit, Joh.</hi> 15. 16. The ſoul's choice of Chriſt is the effect of Chriſt's firſt chuſing him; and its love to God the product of God's firſt loving him, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 19. and the ſoul's fruitfulneſs is the effect of Chriſt's purpoſing and appointing it thereunto. <hi>No man can come to me except the Father which hath ſent me draw him, Joh.</hi> 6. 44. Not onely morally by perſwading the will with potent arguments; but phyſically, by working to will, by a powerful inclining and diſpoſing the will to come to, and chuſe Chriſt, through the irreſiſtible operation of the Spirit: <hi>So then, 'tis not of him that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy, Rom.</hi> 9. 16. Salvation-grace both of righteouſneſs and holineſs, is freely given to the thirſty ſoul through and with Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 6. and the inclination and power to receive as freely beſtowed alſo. <hi>Phil. 1. 29. To you it is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:132285:103"/> given in the behalf of Chriſt, not onely to believe on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> Faith it ſelf is the gift of God, both the power and will to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not given to every man alike: <hi>For all men have not faith, 2 Theſ.</hi> 3. 2. becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not pleaſed effectually to beſtow it. <hi>Deut. 29. 4. The Lord hath not given you a heart to perceive, and eyes to ſee, and ears to hear to this day: Who hath made thee to differ? or what haſt thou which thou didſt not receive? 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 7. If the differencing of one man from another, as to his improvement of grace, lay in his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and natural freedom of his own will, then there was ſomething in the creature that made this difference, contrary to this Scripture; and a foundation laid in a man to glory, which wholly overthrows the deſign of Redemption<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, which is to take off all boaſting, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 29. Rom.</hi> 3. 27. and to lay all the praiſe and glory of man's ſalvation on ſpecial grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5, 6. neither is the firſt grace onely freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but more grace alſo, alſufficiency after (conferred for every good word and work; yea, for every thought that is good) comes from the ſame grace that firſt called you, which muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo perfect every good work to the day of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. our ſufficiency (who have grace) to think or do the leaſt ſpiritual good, is deriv'd from the ſame fountain-fulneſs that is in Chriſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 16. Eternal life, with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever leads thereto, is the gift of God, <hi>Rom. 6. v.</hi> 23. As Chriſt, ſo all things with him are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. not onely the ſeed of grace, but the growth of grace; not onely the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:132285:104"/> habit, but the act of grace; all comes from Chriſt in the way of Redemption-grace. Get your hearts well eſtabliſhed with this grace, that nothing in you, or done by you, can merit or procure any thing of the Father, but upon the account of Chriſt, and his grace, and promiſe in him to all that by the Son do come unto him. Goods you need for a daily Trade, but no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and price will paſs for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. they are freely given, and yet you may boldly come for them: Go you muſt with empty ſacks, your friend in Heaven will fill them, and return your money in your ſacks mouth. Chriſtians, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of your work (and that which laies the foundation to all your Trade) lies in getting your ſouls furniſh'd with heavenly wares: You will drive but a poor Trade for Heaven, if you do not often receive goods from Heaven. Alas! what can you do in Chriſtianity without continual ſupplies from Chriſt? <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea</hi> could not do any good in Religion, for want of goods from Chriſt: She had none of his tryed gold, and therefore grew ſoon poor and miſerable: If goods fail, trade falls, and liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood with it: What advantages doth the Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man miſs, and what loſſes doth he ſuſtain, by wanting goods to furniſh his Cuſtomers? So do Chriſtians when they want grace to ſerve their occaſions, neceſſities, temptations and duties; what advantage might ſouls get, had they but grace, when they come under Ordinances and Duties? and what loſſes do they meet with for want of grace, under afflictions, trials and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments? how pitifully do they carry it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:132285:104"/> troubles, and providential exerciſes, and are oft-times ſadly foil'd for want of grace and wiſdom to manage ſuch trials? You have daily need of more grace, as you have of bread for your bodies: Your occaſions, temptations and work are ſpending, and without freſh ſupplies from the Treaſury, you will ſoon be empty and impoveriſhed: Neglect but your ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits one day, and you will feel it: 'Tis your intereſt, if you are Traders, to keep your ſhops full, and to be often ſending for more goods: Grace will never lye long on your hands; other goods may: You will have ſtill occaſions to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe grace in your dealings with God and men; you can never be over-ſtor'd with Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's wares.</p>
                  <p>'Tis your duty alſo to make uſe of Chriſt continually: In every thing to make known your requeſts to him: To draw waters out of this Well of Salvation every day: He is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſealed for your uſe; he is made of God to be wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption too; for this end, that they might live upon him to theſe ends: This is to live by the Faith of the Son of God, which is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians daily duty: He complains as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd when his people will not come unto him that they might have life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. He is troubled when his Children will not make uſe of him: <hi>Hitherto you have asked nothing: Ask and you ſhall receive that your joy may be full, Joh.</hi> 16. 24. Never was a full breaſt more pain'd for want of drawing, than the Lord Jeſus is, when his people receive not from him that fulneſs
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:132285:105"/> that is laid up in him for their uſe.</p>
                  <p>'Tis your advantage alſo to be often at Chriſt's door, and to be continually fetching in ſupplies for your ſouls: This is the way to grow rich apace; to get in more and more of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable riches of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. This is the way to be filled with the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to be more throughly furniſhed unto all good works, to the glory and praiſe of God, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 17. Phil.</hi> 1. 12. This is the way to do every thing better, and to abound in the work of the Lord, and to be more complete in all the will of God, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 58. Col.</hi> 4. 12. By this means you will become more ſerviceable unto others, and uſeful in the place where you live, and in the Societies where God hath placed you; the more full of grace, the more able to profit others. <hi>Rom. 15. 14. That ye alwaies are full of goodneſs, filled with all knowledge, able al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to admoniſh one another. 2 Cor. 1. 4. That we may be able to comfort them with the ſame comforts wherewith we are comforted of God.</hi> They that freely receive, will be able freely to give; and that's a bleſſed thing, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 35. And till you receive you cannot give. Chriſtians, get in more grace every day for your own uſe, for the glory of God, and the good of others: Labour to be furniſhed with every grace, eſpecially thoſe graces which the Lord hath more uſe of, and the time, condition and place you are in, do more eſpecially call for, <hi>Heb. 12. 28. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                  <p>Be ſure to be well furniſhed with Faith; that's an uſeful grace at all times (for we live by Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38.) but eſpecially in evil times,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:132285:105"/> in times of temptation and affliction. Faith is an eye, a hand, a foot at all times; 'tis a grace alwaies uſeful at every turn; you cannot be without it and be well; 'tis a working grace, and that's good for Traders; you cannot work without it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 4. A building grace, <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 3. 20. A nouriſhing grace, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6. A ſoul-enriching grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 12. A ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrengthening grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 16, 17. But 'tis eſpecially needful in evil times, it being a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. 'Tis a ſoul-keeping grace, and that's good in dangerous times, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. 'Tis a ſoul-ſaving grace, that ſaves in troubles, and out of troubles, <hi>Pſal. 27. 5. Jam.</hi> 5. 15. 'Tis a heart-eſtabliſhing grace, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 20. A world-contemning grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26. A world-conquering grace, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. A ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuring grace, <hi>Heb. 11. 23. By faith Moſes was hid three months.</hi> It ſecures a perſon in troubles: 'tis a breaſt-plate to preſerve the heart, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 8. And a ſhield to cover the head, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 16. It leads a perſon through trouble, <hi>Heb. 11. 29. By Faith they paſſed through the Red. Sea, as by dry Land, which the Egyptians aſſaying to do, were drowned.</hi> O get in plenty of this precious unfeigned Faith, for that's the great trading-grace of a Chriſtian; for it gets in, and laies out every grace. Faith is the receiving grace; it receives in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. and it receives from Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 16. Faith is the key that opens Chriſt's Treaſures; the hand that takes out his tryed gold: Faith is the carrying, and recarrying grace: Faith comes up to the market-price, and never breaks with
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:132285:106"/> God on terms, but ſubſcribes to all the demands of Chriſt, and ſo never returns empty. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, you will never want goods for your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Trade, if you can but keep Faith in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; your ſhops will never be empty, as long as Faith can ſtir up and down, and keep up its Journeys to Heaven: If there be any goods in the promiſes, any wares in Heaven, Faith will have them down, as long as the ſoul needs them, and it be for God's intereſt to part with them: O then get faith! Alas, what pitiful Trade do ſome drive for want of Faith! Choice goods will not off; precious promiſes, pertinent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, perſwaſions and encouragements lye on Chriſt's hands for want of faith in them that hear.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians, you will make nothing of Religion without Faith, in the daies we live in; you will ſoon ſhut up ſhop, decay and break when troubles come to purpoſe, without ſtore of Faith. Faith will fill your ſtore-houſes, do your work, put off your goods, get in your rights, pay your debts, and maintain you richly on the incomes of your Trade.</p>
                  <p>Patience is another grace that will much ſerve you in your Spiritual Trade; you have need of Patience to do the will of God; no working without Patience. 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 12. Truly the ſigns of an Apoſtle were wrought among you in all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Rom. 5. 4. Patience worketh experience.</hi> Souls are apt to be weary of well doing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Patience, and to tyre in running, without this long-breath'd grace of Patience. <hi>Heb. 12. 1. Let us run with Patience the race that is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:132285:106"/> us.</hi> No receiving the fruit of Ordinances and Duties without Patience. <hi>Luke 8. 15. They on the good ground are they which in an honeſt and good heart, having heard the Word, keep it; and bring forth fruit with Patience.</hi> The Lord uſually tries his peoples Patience before they come to the fruit of Pomiſes, and bring forth the obedience of Precepts; there's a winter between ſeed-time and harveſt; many wet, weeping daies between ſowing and reaping, <hi>ut enim ſegetem in agro pluvias, nives, glacies, prui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, grandines, &amp; tempeſtates ferre neceſſarium eſt antequam matureſcat, &amp; fructum ferat, ita homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem fidelem intus &amp; extrinſecus multa pati mala oportet.</hi> Stell. The ſeed muſt lye long, it may may be, under ground, and when 'tis come up, be nipt up with froſts, and covered with ſnow and hail, and bear many a ſtorm before it ripens, and brings forth fruit, and this calls for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; yea many times long-ſuffering. <hi>The huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman waiteth for the precious fruits of the earth, and hath long Patience for it, untill he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the early and latter rain, James</hi> 5. 7. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is needful to ſuffer, as well as do the Will of God. <hi>Rev. 13. 10. Here is the Patience and Faith of the Saints:</hi> To endure captivity and cruell Death for the ſake of Chriſt, Patience to wait for the promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 25. and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to receive it. <hi>Heb. 10. 36. Patience</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca) is a ſalve for every ſore, that onely which alleviates our burdens; without it we cannot be men or Chriſtians:</hi> (ſaith another) '<hi>tis the grace that makes a compleat and well accompliſh'd Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> Manton. <hi>James</hi> 1. 4. When reaſon is at a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:132285:107"/> ſtand, and hope almoſt at an end, and all refuge fails; Patience ſteps in, bears the burden, and calms the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Hope is a neceſſary grace to this great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, reckoned among the three Cardinal vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that wonderfully adorn a Chriſtian's ſpirit and converſation. 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 13. Now abideth Faith, and Hope, and Charity:</hi> Hope is the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring and refreſhment of Faith; 'tis begotten by Faith, and (ſaies one) <hi>As a good child relieves its father Faith in time of need.</hi> Hope is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, Faith a perſwaſion. Faith eyes the promiſe, hope the thing promiſed, as ſure though future, which comforts the ſoul under the preſent want of deſired mercy; and this is needful to cheer the ſoul under its exigencies and diſappointments in the way of its Chriſtian converſation. Hope keeps in the fire, and keeps up the houſe. <hi>Heb. 3. 6. Whoſe houſe are we if we hold faſt the confidence and rejoycing of our hope firm to the end.</hi> Were it not for Hope the houſe would fall aſunder; Hope keeps it together, till the Lord new build it in Heaven: Hope anchors the ſoul in a ſtorm, and makes it ſteady under ſhaking tempeſts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. Hope main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a Chriſtian in a hard winter, while the ſeed is under clods, and till the corn come to the barn. 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 10. He that ploweth, ploweth in Hope</hi> (that is of a good harveſt) that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate all his labours. Hope ſecures the ſoul from ſhame and diſappointment under tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary forbearance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 22. It helps it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in tribulation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. and compaſſeth him about with mercy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 10.</p>

                  <p>Humility, Self-denial, Goodneſs, Temperance, Gentleneſs, Love, Zeal, Holy Fear, are all good goods that will off well, and turn to the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's profit, if well improved: Get your ſouls well ſtor'd with theſe graces of the Spirit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo if you ever think to drive a good Trade of godlineſs,</p>
                  <p>Get your minds filled with knowledge, as well as your hearts with grace; that's part of the Chriſtian's Treaſure. 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 6. We have this Treaſure</hi> (that is of the knowledge of God in the face of Chriſt) <hi>in earthen veſſels: In whom are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom, Col.</hi> 2. 3. Saving knowledge is a Treaſure laid up in Chriſt for Believers, and to be fetched out for their uſe and comfort. <hi>The riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding, and acknowledgement of the myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt, Col.</hi> 2. 2. The Goſpel is a myſtery, a ſecret, hid from the natural eye, and cannot be known but by the revelation of the Spirit. To have an inward, clear, ſenſible, experimental and certain apprehenſion of the glorious truths of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, opened and confirmed to the eye of Faith, is a high attainment beyond what any reach to, but thoſe that have the anointings of the Spirit, and to whom 'tis given by the Spirit as the fruit of prayer, and faithful attendance on his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Goſpel and Ordinances of Chriſt: This is called a rooting and eſtabliſhment in the Faith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 7. and growing in knowledge, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. alluding to trees that being well planted do take deeper root in the earth, and in time come to greater ſettlement and ſtrength
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:132285:108"/> againſt ſhakings: And as children that gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally grow and encreaſe to higher ſtatures; ſo this ſpiritual knowledge is gradually encreaſed; 'tis not the priviledge of new-born babes, of perſons at their firſt converſion, to have this deep fathoming of Goſpel-myſteries: But of ſtronger Chriſtians, who by conſtant attendances on the Means of Grace, and in progreſs of time, by Faith, Humility, Prayer and Attention to the Spirit, do at length come to higher meaſures of this illumination, and full aſſurance of truth. As <hi>Gerſon</hi> reports of a godly man he knew, who at firſt was exerciſed with many doubts and fears, and ſhakings of Faith; but at laſt through humiliation of ſoul, and a captivating of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to Divine Truth, together with the illumination of the Spirit, came to a wonderful clearneſs in the matters of Faith, and of his ſoul-eſtate, with ſuch a ſettlement of ſpirit, and certainty about his ſalvation, as to have no more doubts remaining in him. Chriſtians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not your ſelves with ſome notions of truth, and ſhallow cold apprehenſions of the great myſteries of ſalvation; but labour to get in greater meaſures of ſpiritual underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both objective, as to the Truths to be known; and ſubjective, as to the diſcerning of them: Alas, we know as yet nothing as we ought; there are deeps in the knowledge of Chriſt for Elephants, as well as ſhallows for Lambs; and there are greater beamings on the ſouls eye to be obtained, and more certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and familiar acquaintance to be had with the ſame Truths we know. Your buſineſs,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:132285:108"/> Chriſtians, in the Heavenly Trade is to get more Divine Wiſdom, to be led farther into all Truth, and to enter into the Myſteries of the Goſpel; wading farther and farther into Sanctuary-deeps; to know more of God, of the way to him, and the things freely given of him, and to know better what you know: <hi>Thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed them to babes.</hi> There's a ſecret in Goſpel-truths which the wiſeſt men in the world can never by their greateſt Wiſdom come to ſee, without the ſpecial revelation of the Spirit: As none can come to ſee the ſpirits, ſalts, and occult virtues, in herbs and minerals, till by Chymiſtry they are exſtracted: Others may diſcern and receive the things themſelves in the groſs and bulk of them, and yet never ſee or taſte thoſe choice ſpirits hid in them: So 'tis with ſuch as are ſtrangers to a ſpiritual knowledge, they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Truths in the bulk and letter of them. A <hi>A carnal man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hooker) may hear the ſound of the Word, underſtand the ſignification; his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may ſee the evidence of the argument, and force of reaſon in them; and yet the</hi>

There's no proportion between a ſpiritual object and a caanal eye: <hi>The carnal mind cannot diſcern the things of the Spirit of God, neither can they know them, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 14.

This will guard your hearts from thoſe ſlaviſh fears, darkſom doubts, and dreadful troubles that many are filled with this day, and make you triumph over ſin, trample upon the world, and ſmile in the midſt of all the frowns of men and Devils. O get and keep this rare Jewel of inward Peace, which will help you to draw near to God with boldneſs, and chearful ſerenity in every duty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. Get your conſciences bath'd in the blood of Chriſt, and

                  <p>Get your hearts warm'd, and affections quicken'd with the ſenſe of divine love to your Souls: this is a choice part of heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and will abundantly conduce to the lively carrying on of this divine Trade; affections raiſed by the application of redemption-grace, will be to your Souls as ſpread ſails to the Ship, to carry you ſtrongly along againſt wind and ſtorm, and fill you with pleaſant gales within, and give you a ſpeedy and comfortable paſſage through the waves of this World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12.

His commands will not be thought grievous, or his yoke heavy, where this love of God hath left a ſavour on the heart, <hi>Pſal. 119. 32. Rom.</hi> 13. 10.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:132285:110"/> This ſpiriturl comfort will alſo help to drown your carnal joys, and to prevent a ſurfeit with the pleaſures of this World, (another danger that Wiſdom's Merchants are ſometimes liable to.) <hi>Acts 2. 28. Make me full of joy with the light of thy countenance.</hi> Spiritual joy, where it is, fills the heart, and leaves no room for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal delights; as the heat of the Sun puts out the fire, ſo will ſpiritual conſolation extinguiſh carnal joy: 'Twas the comfort which <hi>Moſes,</hi> by Faith, fetch'd in from the views of an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God, that made him chooſe reproaches with the people of God, before the pleaſures of ſin that were but for a ſeaſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 21. 25.

Look over your ſouls every day, and ſee your poverty; look into your underſtandings, and ſee how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle light is there; into your minds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how little ſpirituality lies there; how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle warmth and heavenly heat in your affections; little truth and ſincerity in your ſpirits; little tenderneſs in your conſciences; little flexible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in your wills to divine things: little faith, love, humility, meekneſs, fear, zeal, life, ſtrength, faithfulneſs, ſtedfaſtneſs in your ſouls: were this really ſeen, and felt, and the excellency of theſe ſpiritual perfections diſcern'd, and the ſoul's great concern and intereſt that lies wrapt up in them, with the abſolute neceſſity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every grace, in order to duty, peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, proſperity and ſalvation; perſons that had any life at all, could not lie ſtill, or be content, till utmoſt means were us'd to obtain ſupplies: 'twas a falſe conceit of a ſelf-fulneſs that kept back <hi>Laodicea</hi> from ſeeking after Chriſt's trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17, 18. And that blind opinion the Phariſees had of their good eſtate that ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd them againſt the convictions and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Chriſt towards their cure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 33. 39. 41. 48.

And have been contentious with one

                  <p>Secondly, Get a believing ſight of Chriſt's grace and fulneſs, that he is able to enrich you, and willing to help you. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. This brought <hi>Naaman</hi> to the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> for cure of his leproſy; he believed his ſervants report, that he was able, and cheriſhed hopes that he was willing to heal him. 2 <hi>Kin. 5. 3. And ſhe ſaid to her Miſtreſs, would God my Maſter were with the Prophet that is in</hi> Samaria, <hi>for he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him of his leproſy:</hi> One told this to her Lord, and hereupon he goes and adventures: <hi>ver. 5. And he departed.</hi> A perſwaſion of Chriſt's ability, brought the Leper to him for cleanſing. <hi>Mat. 8. 2. Lord, if thou wilt, thou can'ſt make me clean:</hi> He was perſwaded that Chriſt was able, and had hopes that he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or would never have come to him. A thorough belief of Chriſt's ability to help, will make a ſoul to cheriſh hopes of his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs alſo. So the blind men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. they believed Chriſt's ability to help them; <hi>ver.</hi> 28. And they had hopes of his mercy too, that he would do it: <hi>ver. 27. Thou Son of</hi> David <hi>have mercy upon us:</hi> and this hope made them not only to come to Chriſt, but to follow after him: whatever perſons pretend to a believing in Chriſt's ability to ſave and ſanctify them, they have not this faith, who queſtion his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:132285:111"/> to ſatisfy the longing ſoul, and ſave all that come to God by him: you confeſs he is able to furniſh you with all you can want or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; believe his willingneſs alſo to ſupply all your wants, who ſincerely wait upon him.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how may I know that Chriſt will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me if I come for theſe heavenly treaſures? there are many come, and go without their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand: Some ask, and have not, <hi>Jam. 4. 3.</hi> run, and receive not; ſtrive to enter in, and are not able, <hi>1 Cor. 9. 24. Luke 13. 24.</hi> There are ſome the Lord threatens he will not hear, <hi>Prov. 1. 28. Iſa. 1. 15. Zech. 7. 13.</hi> And I have ſought theſe ſpiritual bleſſings many a time, and God hath not anſwered: How may I be ſure Chriſt is willing to give theſe treaſures un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me?</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> The Lord Jeſus hath made an offer of grace to all ſenſible Sinners, who feel their need, and thirſt for ſupply, <hi>Iſa. 55. 1. Joh.</hi> 7. 37. and called upon them to come and receive it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. Now it cannot ſtand with his divine goodneſs and truth to offer mercy, and not intend to give it; he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or be deceived, who is the faithful one; nor invite his creatures to an expectation, and then fail them. Now he hath called all to come, and required no other condition but their coming, and receiving him and the things he hath offered. He hath alſo promiſed, as well as offered, to give to him that thirſteth. <hi>Rev. 20. 6. I will give to him that is a-thirſt of the fountain
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:132285:112"/> of the water of life freely.</hi> I will give, (not ſell) or let out on any terms of ſelf-worthineſs; for if there be any thing to make the creature wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, 'tis not a gift, but debt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. [To him that is a-thirſt,] nothing elſe is required but a pinching ſenſe of ſouls need, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied deſire of ſupply. [I will give free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,] out of no reſpect to any thing in the creature, but his neceſſity and miſery; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſe is his own grace and free mercy to Sinners, as Sinners. [I will give liberally too;] let him drink freely, take as much as he needs, or is capable to receive. [I will give ſutably,] ſuch things as you deſire and need, and ſuch things as are capable of ſatisfying you, (<hi>of the fountain of the waters of life.) Matth. 7. 7. Pſal. 36. 7, 8. Joh. 6. 37. Iſa.</hi> 41. 17. You will find nothing in theſe Scriptures required in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but ſenſe of his need, ſeeking ſatisfaction, coming, believing, and a real ſubjection to all God's terms, and a pure deſigning of his ends. I diſclaim all; the Port I would be in at, is redemption and forgiveneſs through his blood; <hi>Ruth.</hi> Now, if he hath promiſed to give to them that ſeek, he muſt be willing to give; <hi>For the holy one of</hi> Iſrael <hi>cannot lye,</hi> Numb. 23. 19. He hath received all his Mediatory fulneſs of purpoſe for the giving out to thoſe that come unto him. <hi>Joh. 1. 12. Pſal. 68. 18. Thou haſt received gifts for men, yea for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord God might dwell amongst them:</hi> He is the Angel, Meſſenger and Mediator of the new Covenant, the Truſtee and Feoffee entruſted with that great eſtate for the uſe of his people
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:132285:112"/> that need it, and come unto him for it, <hi>Mal. 3. 1. Heb.</hi> 9. 15. And therefore is ſaid to appear in Heaven in the preſence of God for them, as an Advocate to follow their cauſe. The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is wonderfully pleaſed too, in giving to his needy ſeeking ones. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 18. He delighteth in mercy. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 27. He hath pleaſure in the proſperity of his ſervants: the more he gives, the more he ſees of the travel of his ſoul, and is ſatisfied. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. The more he gives, the more he receives: The gifts and graces of God are as the rivers that flow from the Sea, and return to the Sea again. 1 <hi>Chron. 29. 14. Of thine own have we given thee:</hi> The more Chriſt gives to his people, the more he receives; his talents come in again with improvements, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 27. The more he gives, the more he is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. Anſwer theſe queſtions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you doubt Chriſt's willingneſs to part with ſpiritual goods freely to all that truly ſeek them. Do you think really that Chriſt can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, offer mercy, and have no mind to give it? Do you think that the Lord Jeſus can break his word, or become falſe to his promiſe? Can you imagine he will be unfaithful to his truſt? Can he delight in giving, and yet not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Doth he gain by giving, and yet not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give? Is he glorified by giving, and yet be loth to give? then would he not care for his own name. Suſpect your willingneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, not Chriſt's to give you all that grace you need and ſeek of him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Another thing wherein this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Trade lies, is, to carry on heavenly work,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:132285:113"/> and to be daily driving on the great buſineſs of godlineſs. Religion hath its work as well as the world; every Trade hath its employment, and ſo has godlineſs. Chriſtianity is not a notion or opinion, a name to live, and no more: 'Tis a miſerable vanity and cheat for a perſon to think a bare Lamp will light him to Heaven, and a few lazy wiſhes bring him to glory, though he travel not the way to it. Alas, to eſpouſe the principles of Piety, without the practice of it, to get over to priviledges, and be ſtrangers to Purity, to profeſs Faith without works, and love without labours, will ſignifie nothing towards ſalvation. Will Opinion make a man an Artiſt, or imagination enrich him, or hunger fill him, or reading the way to a place bring him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? No more will affection, knowledge and profeſſion help men to Heaven, unleſs they work out their ſalvation, and carry on the duties of Religion that lead to it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſider, a Chriſtian hath much work, and a little time; great work, and ſmall ſtrength; neceſſary work, and many diverſions; excellent work, none like it: perſons that ſet about ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in earneſt, will find much to do; and the farther they go in Religion, the more buſie their employment will be: every day brings its work with it; new inſtructions, new mercies, new afflictions and temptations every day, which calls for much exerciſed grace and duty. A child of God hath no time for idleneſs, or imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent buſineſs. O the many things that muſt be diſpatched within the compaſs of this little inch of time for eternity! Soul, if thou dieſt, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:132285:113"/> thy work undone when thou dieſt, thy ſoul's undone; there's no riſing from thy grave to do neglected work; or diſpenſation at the Bar of God for the omiſſion of Salvation-duties.</p>
                  <p>This work is neceſſary alſo as well as great; ſome duties are neceſſary to ſecure thy ſalvation; all duties are neceſſary to maintain thy comforts, and greaten thy glory. Men plead neceſſity for this and th' other thing, to do this work, and take that journey; to omit this duty, and abſent from ſuch a priviledge; but who is ſenſible of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of working the work of God, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſoul-concerns? It may not be neceſſary you ſhould have peace, credit, plenty, riches, comforts; that you ſhould have ſo much eſtate, preferment and contentment in the world; but 'tis abſolutely neceſſary thy ſoul ſhould be ſaved, and that God ſhould be obeyed; that ſpiritual concerns ſhould be attended, (whatever is neglected) that thy debts ſhould be paid, thy peace with God obtained, thy hungry ſoul be fed and refreſhed, thy title to Heaven clear'd, the preſence of God enjoy'd, and thy ſeed-time for glory improv'd.</p>
                  <p>'Tis promiſed-work too, and that makes it neceſſary; you have engag'd to be the Lord's if you are Chriſtians; and have given up your ſelves to be his, and not your own; your time is his, your capacities his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20. what you are and have, is from him and for him; this you have devoted to the uſe and ſervice of God when you took him to be your God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. and many a time ſince you have engag'd to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his commands: There are ſick-bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vows,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:132285:114"/> affliction-promiſes, engagements under conſcience-troubles; yea every day, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duty, you tell God you will mend your waies, redeem your time, do him more and better work; and how can you ſtand before him with ſuch flattery and diſſimulation, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of ſo much falſhood and treachery, while your work lies ſtill undone?</p>
                  <p>Yea your work Chriſtians is excellent work alſo, above all the employments of the world; 'tis ſupernatural work, yea Angelical work, yea ſuch work as Angels cannot do, to believe in, love, converſe with, and obey Chriſt, as your Redeemer and Saviour, <hi>Phil. 3. 10. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9, 12. to ſuffer for Chriſt, and be baptized into a conformity with his death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Chriſtians ſet upon heavenly work; for as is your work, ſo will your main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance be: They who do that work which the world cannot, have that meat and drink which the world knoweth not, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 32, 34.

                  <p>Thirdly, As is your work, ſo will your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany be: They that do earthly work, have earthly companions to labour with them: As is mens Trade, ſuch is their company. <hi>The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the night have their fellowſhip with unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full works of darkneſs, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 11. and gracious ſouls are <hi>companions with them that fear God, Pſal.</hi> 119. 63.

                     </gap>) is uſed for a free reward that hath no reſpect to deſert, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 8. The ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward being given to him that wrought one hour, as to thoſe that bore the heat and burden of the day: So that the word (<hi>according</hi>) notes the kind of work, not the cauſe of reward,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:132285:116"/> reward as it refers to ſalvation: Suitable to that of Chriſt, <hi>Rev. 22. 12. Behold I come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work ſhall be:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Indeed evil works have their cauſality, and deſert of puniſhment, but not good works of reward: <hi>Gryner</hi> gives three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the difference: Firſt, Becauſe good works proceed from God, and are the fruits of his Spirit in us; but evil works proceed from man, and are the effects of his own ſpirit and will. Secondly, good works are imperfectly good as to degrees, and therefore cannot merit; but evil works are perfectly evil, and therefore deſerve death. Thirdly, Good works are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and ſo are but our duty, and cannot merit, (payment of debts are not purchaſe) but ſins are forbidden, and ſo are a breach of the Law of God, and deſerve death. <hi>Luke 17. 10. The gift of God is eternal life, but the wages of ſin is death, Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Death is wages due, but life is a gift altogether free. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 5. There can be no deſert of glory in the moſt ſpiritual duties of man: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They are not man's work, but God's in him, <hi>John 15. 5. Without me ye can do nothing, Gal. 2. 20. I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> Holineſs is called the fruit of the Spirit, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 9. Now the reward is due by way of debt to him that worketh; but to him that worketh not, 'tis of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4, 5. and therefore reward is not due to Saints who work not, but by ſtrict way of juſtice ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:132285:117"/> to the Spirit that worketh in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They are no way proportionable to the reward, and ſo not meritorious: Their work is imperfect, they know but in part, and do but in part, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 9. Phil.</hi> 3. 12. The beſt duties as they come from the Saints here, are ſpotty, and as ſweet waters that come from an evil veſſel, they ſavour of the cask through which they come; but glory is perfect, <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus modis,</hi> and hath no defect in it; Our works alſo are finite, being created, and creature-acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but the reward is infinite, the love and glory of an infinite God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Though our Holineſs were perfect, yet it could not merit; becauſe it is due to God from that relation we bear to him as his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and redeemed ones, and from our promiſe and covenant with him to love, obey and ſerve him, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 10. 2 Cor.</hi> 8. 5. Duties are but debts, not acts of favour to God: We owe God our ſelves, and our all, and are indebted to Chriſt for his Redemption-grace, more than we can ever pay; we cannot (though we do all we poſſible can) requite the blood of Chriſt, and love of Chriſt; and till we are out of debt we cannot merit.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We have nothing to merit withal, for we are not our own, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. Man hath nothing to give to God, who is not his own, but God's (as all redeemed ones eſpecially are) Believers are his ſervants: <hi>Rom. 14. 4. Who art thou that judgeſt another man's ſervant?</hi> And a ſervant is not his own; his time, ſtrength, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, work, are his Maſters; ſo are the Saints
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:132285:117"/> duties the Lord's, not by way of legal compact, and requital of wages, but by way of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, right and purchaſe, being bought out of the ſervice of ſin and Satan to his own uſe; and the ſervice of ſuch is a due already upon a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſcore; a debt of thankfulneſs, and cannot merit a reward: Beſide, what can they give to God, who have nothing but what they receive from God? 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 7. Who hath firſt given to him? and it ſhall be recompenſed to him again: for of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Were rewards due to any upon the account of his work, then man had ſomething to glory of in himſelf, and might ſay of Heaven as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did of <hi>Babylon, Dan. 4. 30. Is not this great Babylon which I have built for the houſe of the Kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my Majeſty?</hi> So might ſuch ſay when they come to Heaven; Is not this the manſion I prepared and deſerved by my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and graces, for my glory and bleſſedneſs? For ſelf-juſticiaries, though they are forced to ſay that their grace is given of God; yet they boaſt of the improvements of this grace as theirs, and glory is due to the improvement of grace (they ſay) and not to the bare grace or talent; and though they are driven to confeſs Chriſt's merit, yet they ſhuffle and ſay, Chriſt merited for them, that they might merit: But that is contrary to the Goſpel, which tells us, That <hi>'tis not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy, Rom. 9. v. 16. And 'tis God that worketh in you both to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:132285:118"/> will and to do of his good pleaſure, Phil. 2. 13. And that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence, 1 Cor. 1. 29. And therefore God hath choſen the fooliſh, weak; and baſe things of this world, and things that are not, of purpoſe to prevent this ſelf-glorying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, verſe</hi> 17, 18. And the Apoſtle makes this reaſon why <hi>Abraham</hi> was not juſtified by Works, but by Faith, cauſe then he would have ſomething to glory in; but this could not be. <hi>Rom. 4. 2. If Abraham were juſtified by works, he had ſomething to glory in, but not before God.</hi> So that the Saints, though they have a reward of their work, yet it is not for their work; 'tis a reward, not of debt, but of grace; yea of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious grace, <hi>according to your work.</hi> (Chriſtians) God will not give you a jot leſs than the utmoſt of what your love and faithfulneſs comes to; <hi>Your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 58. He will not fail of any of his Promiſes, or diſappoint you of your expected end, but will be better than your hopes: You will ſay in that day of compenſation, <hi>Who hath begotten me all theſe? Iſa. 49. 21. Whence is this to me? Luk. 1. v. 43. When ſaw we thee an hungred? Mat. 26. v.</hi> 37. Glory is a mighty thing, infinitely above all your labours: Chriſtians, Heaven will make amends for all your duties and loſſes, and abundantly compenſate, and exceed all your expences for God in the world: And have: you not reaſon to ſet about the work of grace, and drive on the employments of this Heavenly Trade?</p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:132285:118"/>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what is this heavenly work which Wiſdom's Merchants muſt be driving on every day?</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer; Firſt, in the general; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly work is that work which hath a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Author and Principle; a heavenly rule, and a heavenly end: work wrought of God by his Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 21. Work done according to the will of God, and by Scripture-rule, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 12. Work wrought for God, and deſigned purely and ultimately to his glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31.</p>
                  <p>But more particularly, heavenly works may be conſidered under theſe two heads.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such as are heavenly in the matter of them, as well as manner and end.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Such works, as though earthly in the matter of them, yet are done in a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, and to an heavenly end.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That's heavenly work which is of a heavenly nature, matter, and manner, and end; as all thoſe religious duties are which reſpect God, our ſelves, and others.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Drive on that work every day which hath God himſelf for its firſt and more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate object, as all acts of religious worſhip, both natural and inſtituted, moral and poſitive. <hi>Mat. 4. 10. Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve:</hi> This is due to God from all his rational and intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both Men and Angels to worſhip him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with that reverential fear, faith, love, hope and delight which is due to him, as the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:132285:119"/> Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, the great Creator and Conſervator of all his creatures; and to ſerve him with that ſubjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as their relation to God their Sovereign calls for. This is the duty of all perſons, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that profeſs their owning of God, and choice of him to be their God in Chriſt, and peculiar treaſure. <hi>Deut. 13. 6. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, and ſerve him, and ſwear by his name.</hi> Chriſtians, to let out your hearts upon the world, relations, ſelf, and creatures, is to rob God of his ſervice, and to commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry with the creature. Think this, when my heart runs out to things below God, and my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, hope, truſt and delight get over their banks, and break their due bounds, and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinacy to God: when I fondly dote upon, and take pleaſure (abſtractively from God) in any creatures, then do I deal treacherouſly with my God, I rob him, and give his glory to another, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 11. O ſet habitually your hearts on God, and let out your faith, love, hope, fear, deſires, and delighting pleaſures on God every day, yea all the day long, as your chiefeſt good, ſupreme Sovereign, and laſt end. <hi>Prov. 27. 17. Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, external acts of divine worſhip are part of thy every days work, which thou oweſt to God, and to be duly and daily performed to him, as to pray, hear, and read his ſacred word: Theſe are that honour, homage and ſervice that is due to God every day, eſpecially morning and evening; <hi>Prov. 8. 34. Deut. 6. 7. Exod. 30. 7. 1 Chron. 23. 30. Ezek.</hi> 46. 13, 14, 15.

                  <p>Herein lies your profeſſed ſubjection to God alſo; ſlight religious duties, and you reject God from being your God: This very reaſon doth <hi>Moſes</hi> give why <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould ſerve the Lord, and cleave to him, and ſwear by his name, and give him all religious worſhip, <hi>Deut. 19. 20, 21. He is thy praiſe, and he is thy God, who hath done for thee theſe great and terrible things which thine eyes have ſeen.</hi> Dan. 6. 16. <hi>Thy God whom thou ſerveſt continually, he will deliver thee:</hi> 'Tis a contradiction to ſay that God is your God, and yet with-hold his ſervice from him: As ſoon as ever God had a people in the World, he had ſervice from them. <hi>Gen. 4. 26. Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord:</hi> No ſooner had <hi>Seth</hi> (who was the other ſeed which the Lord appropriated to himſelf in the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:132285:120"/> room of <hi>Abel</hi>) a Son and Family, but they had peculiar worſhip for God, and were diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Family of <hi>Cain</hi> by this, that they did ſerve God: This is the work of God, that every Soul is bound to diſpatch every day, in Cloſet and Family, in Spirit and Truth, with a pure heart fervently.</p>
                  <p>This alſo is the beſt part of your work in the world, to attend on God; all other ſervice is but drudgery, compared with your ſerving God, and tranſacting the great matters of your Souls, and your everlaſting concern. This is your intereſt alſo, to maintain nearneſs to God, who is the life of your ſouls, the length of your days, and fountain of all your ſupplies; there's no ſuch pleaſure as in the ways of God, nor profit as in keeping his commands. O the bleſſedneſs of converſe with God, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a daily entercourſe with the Father of Spirits! 'tis the priviledg of Angels, and of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints, to be always beholding his face, 1 <hi>Theſ. 4. 17. Mat.</hi> 18. 10. And the peculiar honour of the upright to dwell in his preſence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140. 12.</p>
                  <p>There is no ſuch advantage alſo as to be much with God every day. <hi>Pſal. 73. 28. 'Tis good for me to draw near to God:</hi> Often journeys to Heaven bring in much profit; 'twas this way <hi>David</hi> did thrive ſo much in wiſdom, grace and experience, out-ſhining all the men of that age, and ſerving his generation by the will of God; <hi>his being much with God.</hi> Pſal. 139. 18. <hi>When I awake I am ſtill with thee:</hi> By this near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Son of righteouſneſs did <hi>Enoch</hi> ſo
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:132285:120"/> ſoon ripen for Heaven; and by his conſtant walks with God, did he ſo timely get to his journeys end. Of all that generation, we find none ſo ſoon ſent for home, and tranſlated to his reſt, as holy <hi>Enoch;</hi> for whereas the reſt lived nine hundred, eight hundred, ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; only he lived three hundred ſixty and five years, and that which ſo quickned his fitneſs for reſt, was his activity in heavenly work: <hi>Enoch walked with God, and was not, for God took him, Gen.</hi> 5. 23. He kept his conſtant turns with God in his Garden and Gallery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walks, and then went in with him into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence-Chamber, there to ſit down with him for ever.</p>
                  <p>This alſo will make you thrive in your own work, if you are faithful and diligent in God's work; mind his concerns, and he will care for yours, <hi>Deut. 30. 9. Obey the voice of the Lord, and do all his commandments, and the Lord thy God will make thee plenteous in every good work of thy hand;</hi> He ſhall make thee to abound in the work of thy hand; (as 'tis in the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) <note n="*" place="bottom">

Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, if ever you will thrive in your own work, be ſure to carry on God's work: begin with God every day, the firſt fruits are his. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch religious worſhip in your Cloſets and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies before you enter on your earthly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Cloſe up every day with him, he is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and end, and muſt have the iſſue as well as entrances of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day. The morning and evening ſacrifice are his, 1 <hi>Chron. 16. 40. 2 Chron. 13. 11. Pſal.</hi> 55. 17. Give God his due, before you render to Nature its dues. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61. 8. Pay your vows to God every evening, before you run on ſcore for new mercies: See all things ſecured in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Arms before you lie down to reſt; put
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:132285:121"/> thy Soul and thy All into the hands of Chriſt by ſolemn devotion and reſignation every night; get the watch ſet, and all things ſafe, before thou expoſeſt thy ſelf to the hazards of the night, and entereſt upon an incapacity to ſecure thy ſelf from the leaſt danger. O precious ſouls! lye not down as dogs and ſwine, who, when they have filled their bellies, get to their ſtyes and kennels.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, carry on all that work daily which hath a more ſpecial reſpect to your own ſelves, and leads to the ſanctifying, comforting, ſtrengthning, edifying, ſaving of your precious ſouls. Next to the glory of God, yea in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of it, thy own Salvation is thy chief concern; <hi>What will it profit a man to gain the whole World, and to loſe his own Soul? or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> What is left, if the Soul be loſt? and what is done, if, after all, the Soul be undone? To look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others Souls, and neglect thy own; and to ſecure all things elſe, and leave deſtruction on thy ſelf, is folly like to hers that ſaved her goods from the fire, but left her child to periſh in the flames. Salvation is your chiefeſt work, committed to your care, and to be accounted for in the day of Chriſt. <hi>Phil. 2. 12. Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> And 'tis great work alſo, many things muſt be attended too, and ſeveral things diſpatch'd, if ever Souls be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Firſt; You muſt carry on heart-work every day, and that's great work: they that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their own hearts, know there
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:132285:122"/> is much to do in and about them: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more out of order than man's heart, and nothing in man of greater concernment than the heart: Hence 'tis the ſtrict charge the Lord gives his people to keep their hearts, <hi>Prov. 4. v. 23. Above all keeping</hi> (as 'tis in the Hebrew) <hi>keep thy heart, Proz. 23. 2. Epheſ. 3. 17. Prov. 4. v.</hi> 4. The heart is the one thing Chriſt looks for; the chief room he dwells in; his ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where he laies up his goods; his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where he cuts out, and prepares his work, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 1. A great part of ſalvation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work is done in the ſecret chambers of the heart: The heart is the root and ſpring in man whence all aceptable duties flow, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 6. doing the will of God from the heart;</hi> and to be eſpecially looked after. A Chriſtian finds a great deal of work to do about his heart every day: There is</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heart-ſearching work, Pſal.</hi> 64. 6. The heart of man is deep, and not eaſily fathom'd; 'tis a long journey to the fartheſt end of the heart, which no man ever yet reached in this life: The Sea is deep, and yet it hath a bottom: The World is large, and yet it hath been compaſſed; but who hath ever travelled through his own heart, to ſet up his <hi>non ultra,</hi> and ſay, Hitherto its wickedneſs goes, and no farther. <hi>'Tis deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alſo above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it? Jer.</hi> 17. 9. A man hath no ſuch cheater to deal with as his own heart; it hath ſuch <hi>Cameleon</hi> colours, <hi>Maeander</hi> windings; ſuch labyrinth turnings, ſubtle ſhifts, falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, cloſe deſigns, fair promiſes, ſmooth
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:132285:122"/> excuſes, rhetorical pleas, ſeeming integrity, deep-rooted hypocriſie, that a man cannot tell what to make of his heart, or how to find it out; and this calls for conſtant ſearchings and obſervings of the heart: Beſides, the Lord gives his people the ballance of the Sanctuary on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to weigh it in, and caſts out a line of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence every day to try it by. Men meet with occaſional providences, temptations, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, companies, changes, mercies, afflictions; all which help to diſcover the heart; the iſſue of which is to be obſerved in order to the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of thy heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heart-judging work:</hi> When Chriſtians have found out the evil of their hearts, their pride, hypocriſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeen the proof and evidence clear, and how contrary to Law and Goſpel, to Equity and Mercy, to Light, Experience, Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Patience, Profeſſion and Promiſes, they are then to charge theſe things upon the heart, to ſet home the evil with all the aggravations of it, from its nature and effects, from the quality of the perſon, the time, place, continuance in it, attempts and means of cure, compared with others beneath them for light, profeſſion, means and mercies; and having by theſe arguments convinced the heart of its exceeding evil, then to paſs ſentence againſt, and condemn it as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any mercy, and deſerving of all the threatnings in the Word againſt it, until the heart come to bear its iniquity, and feel its exceeding ſinfulneſs, and cry out with the Apoſtle, <hi>O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death? Rom.</hi> 7. 24. This would
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:132285:123"/> be of wonderful uſe to clear up your ſincerity, to preſerve the tenderneſs of your ſpirits, to cut off all excuſes, falſe hopes, and ſecurity in ſin, and make it more abominable when it appears with its moſt taking allurements, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 11. 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 31. and this would evidence your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in pardon, and freedom from Divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heart-humbling work.</hi> O the pride that lodges, yea lives in, and incorporates with this little piece the heart of man! how unſearchable is it, and paſt finding out! like leaven in the lump, and poyſon in the cup, which cannot be ſeparated by a humane hand; as rottenneſs in the bones, that cannot be fetched out. Pride is as that lofty mountain before <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> which muſt become a plain, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 7. as deeply rooted trees, whoſe Mores are not eaſily pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. One compares ſpiritual pride, to the ſhirt, or inmoſt garment, which the Saints laſt of all put off; and which like the Ivy, will not be pluckt out, till the wall in which it is comes down alſo. O the tuggings a child of God hath with his proud heart, to get and keep it low! As the Spider, whatever it feeds on it turns to poiſon: So is it with the proud heart of man; it turns all it does, hath, meets with, and ſees to the nouriſhment of pride; proud of its ſins; proud of his graces; proud under afflictions, and proud of mercies; proud of honour, and proud of humility; proud of God's favour, and proud under his frowns. O what a ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is pride, that feeds upon the means which the Lord gives to cure it, and gets ſtrength
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:132285:123"/> from the remedy to nouriſh the diſeaſe! like <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s wound; when God would have heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one, another appeared: And this helps to make a Chriſtian's work great work indeed, which is never done till his day be done, and his Tabernacle pulled down.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heart-purging work:</hi> The heart of man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is a very ſink and kennel of uncleanneſs; a fountain of pollution; a running Iſſue full of filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, <hi>Mat. 18. 19. Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, fornications, thefts, falſe witneſs, blaſphemies; theſe are the things that defile the man.</hi> 'Tis not accidental and adventitious filthineſs, for that may more eaſily be waſht away, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 7. but 'tis innate and connatural, and never ceaſes bubling forth, till the fountain be cleanſed, and the root be changed. Sin in the heart is the root and ſpring of all the wickedneſs that defiles the thoughts, words and actions. Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their thoughts; they are peſtred with vain, unclean, diſtracting thoughts in duty, and out of duty; whereas the diſtemper lies in the heart: Thoughts are but the ebullitions and ſwarmings of the heart: He that will cure his thoughts, muſt firſt cleanſe his heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. The heart is the neſt where theſe Waſps fly out and trouble the ſoul; the root that feeds theſe luxuriant branches, briars and thorns that wound the conſcience; and the ſtrong fort of <hi>Sion,</hi> where theſe <hi>Jebuſites</hi> hide themſelves, and iſſue out to prey upon the gracious ſoul: Till theſe neſts be ſpoiled, the Ax laid to the root of the tree, and this ſtrong Tower attach'd, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:132285:124"/> theſe blind and lame removed, ſouls will never be freed from irruptions of ſin in their thoughts and converſations: This (Chriſtian) is buſie and hard work, and part of thy daily employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Heavenly Trade; to ſweep, waſh, drain and cleanſe thy filthy heart, by ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith in the promiſes, death and blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heart-quickening work.</hi> The heart is the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> the great wheel in the watch that ſets all a going; if that ſtop, all faculties are ſtill: A lively heart makes a diligent hand to rid away ſoul-work, and a nimble foot to run in the waies of God's commands; when the heart is quickened, then every duty, inward, outward, publick, private goes on; ſuch a ſoul needs no ſpur to quicken it, nor pully to draw it to its duties. O what a burden are ſome to their Chriſtian friends, to keep them up, and draw them on in the way of God, and all becauſe their hearts are dead, and that livelineſs which once ſeem'd to be in them is departed! The ſpring that at firſt made them ſo active, is weakened or broken; the waters that ſet their Mills a going fail, and that temporary love, and common grace, like ſtanding pools having no fountain to maintain them, are dried up by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming luſts, and ſcorching temptations; ſo that now they wither in all their branches, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weak, cold, and indiſpoſed to every work of God and their ſouls. Some of theſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſymptoms of decayed grace, are found alſo in ſincere ſouls, for not looking after their hearts betimes, and keeping them cloſe to a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:132285:124"/> quickening Jeſus, by a lively faith in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Chriſtian, mind this alſo every day, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thy ſpiritual life, by freſh quickenings, and reviving influences, from the fountain of life, on thy weak and dying heart, making uſe of all inſtituted helps for ſoul-ſtrengthening; as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading, meditation, holy conference, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Heart-teaching and enlightening work.</hi> A light head, and a dark heart may dwell together; and it ſeems to be the condition of too many under the Goſpel this day. A ſpiritual eye to look into the myſtery of truth, and believing affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate diſcerning of excellent things, is not eaſily found; even while Chriſt is read, a veil is on mens minds, and their fooliſh heart is darkened: And this is one reaſon ſouls walk not as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light; 'tis becauſe they are not light in the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 8. The Law of God is not within their hearts; they have no inclination or power upon their hearts to do the will of God they know, for want of this heart-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Be earneſt with God to beam over your hearts, to make that the Hemiſphere where the Sun of Righteouſneſs may daily ariſe with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his wings: Cry with <hi>David, Pſal. 119. 36. Incline my heart to thy Law:</hi> Let my heart lean and ſtay upon thy Law, as a man doth upon a ſtaff tobear him up: Get a greater nearneſs in your hearts to truth, that the Word may be wrought in, and incorporated into your hearts; that it may be a <hi>Goſhen,</hi> a Land of Viſion, and full of the underſtanding of the Lord.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Heart-keeping and Heart-watching work.</hi> The heart is bent to backſliding, if it be not kept and held faſt to the Lord and his waies; 'tis ſtill turning aſide, and winding off from its proper duty. The Lord complains of <hi>Iſrael, Pſal. 78. 8. They did not ſet their heart aright, and their ſpirit was not ſtedfaſt with God:</hi> They did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, adapt, diſpoſe their heart to God; neither was it conſtant and ſtedfaſt with him, but on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion did ſtart aſide: So falſe a thing is man's heart, if not under a watchful eye, and ſtrong hand, holding it faſt to God. <hi>Prov. 4. 23. Keep thy heart with all diligence:</hi> Keep it as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lock and key, bolted againſt ſin, and bound by cords of love to every duty: And what a hard province is this! O the work that a child of God hath to keep his heart in order one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to keep down ſin; to keep it from the power of corruption, and prevalency of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; to keep up grace in the heart; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its deſires after God, and things that are excellent; to preſerve its affections to things above; to hold the thoughts on God, and things eternal, that they ſtart not away; to continue its integrity; to perform its purpoſes; to ſecure its frames, experiences and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! And he that will thus keep his heart, muſt watch it conſtantly, never have his eye off from it, or ſuffer his jealouſie concerning it to ceaſe: He muſt be alwaies making it over to the Lord Jeſus for ſecurity, and be ſtill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring help from Heaven, faithfully following all the inſtructions he gives towards its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing: This is heart-work, and the firſt part
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:132285:125"/> of this heavenly work that concerns your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You muſt carry on mortification<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work every day. <hi>Col. 3. 5. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, uncleanneſs, inordinate affection, evil concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, and covetouſneſs which is Idolatry.</hi> The Apoſtle having aſſur'd the believing <hi>Coloſſians</hi> of their future happineſs, doth thence infer their duty and neceſſity to preſs after utmoſt holineſs here, as the way to this bleſſedneſs: The firſt part of which holineſs lies in this great work of mortification: there is no greater motive for Believers putting off ſin, than well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded hopes of intereſt in Chriſt and glory: if Heaven be yours hereafter, holineſs muſt be yours now: There is no place for ſin in Heaven, nor unclean thing can enter there. Then haſten away ſin now; that's his Argument: [Mortify your members;] Get your ſelves rid of ſin; put to death, weaken and deſtroy the whole body of ſin, with all the parts and iſſues of it; the head and ruling power of ſin had its mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wound before: <hi>verſ. 3. Ye are dead;</hi> habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dead to ſin, the world, and ſelf; they have got their deaths-wound, the ſtab is at the heart, and can never be healed more: but they are not actually dead, more blood muſt run, and ſpirits be ſpent, and this monſter be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every day: Practical mortification is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and muſt be promoted daily. <hi>This ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual death to ſin</hi>

So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth not preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy corruptions from the people, that by them their ſincerity may be proved, their graces ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, and the mighty power of his ſpirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted: This makes a Chriſtian's work buſy, and conſtant, having to do with potent enemies within and without, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 4. which muſt be fought every day, and a continual war main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with them during life: without fighting, no conquering; without ſtriving, no crowning, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. 'Tis with a child of God, as with <hi>Iſrael</hi> when fighting with <hi>Amalek,</hi> if the hands of Faith and Prayer be not held up, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; when theſe are down, ſpiritual <hi>Amalek</hi> prevails. O the loſſes that Chriſtians ſuſtain for want of mortification, by reaſon of which
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:132285:126" rendition="simple:additions"/> their foil'd corruptions rally up, and take their graces captive! <hi>Let men neglect the conſtant practice of mortification,</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Si neglexerint perpetuam praxim mortificationis vitia conculcata &amp; ſubacta reſumunt vires, corruptio ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenſa repullulat &amp; ſuffocata gratia ſpiritus ſancti redit homo ad ingenium ſuum.</hi> Dav.</note> (ſaith <hi>Davenant) and their vices that were trod down and ſubdued, will ſoon reſume their ſtrength; their corruption that was lopt off will bud out again, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Spirit in them being almoſt ſtrangled, man returns to his former temper.</hi> Hence come thoſe dreadful fears of good ſouls, that the grace of God was never in truth in them, but that they are ſtill in a carnal ſtate, and ſhall periſh at laſt, and all this for want of carrying on the work of mortification in them: As a lively Faith overcomes ſin, ſo prevailing luſt weakens Faith, 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 4. Eph.</hi> 4. 2. 30. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the ſealing-work of the Spirit, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the work of the Soul's hopes, filling it with fears about the unſoundneſs of his eſtate, and the miſerable iſſue of all his profeſſion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and labour. By this ladder of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified ſin, the Devil ſcales the royal fort of Faith, throws down its Towers, and mans it againſt the Soul's peace, comfort and holineſs. O the miſchief that Chriſtians do to themſelves by indulging ſin, and for want of a vigorous purſuit of this great duty of mortification! which makes them like to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who being once upon the borders of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were by their unbelief, and unſubdued luſts, brought back near the confines of <hi>Egypt</hi> again, and after a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:132285:127"/> wearying unconſtant life, were conſum'd in the wilderneſs at laſt. So 'tis with gracious Souls, by their unmortified luſts, after ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes to grace, taſtes of divine love, hopes of glory, and fairneſs for Heaven, they are brought back to the borders of Hell again, and made to ſpend their life in an uncomfortable and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtreſſing wilderneſs. Chriſtians, 'tis not ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity enough for your peace and ſpiritual wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, that ſin hath loſt its dominion, unleſs its ſtrength and life be impaired alſo: dethroned ſin may bid you many a battel, and give you ſore foils, and though it may not recover the Scepter, yet it may keep the Sword; and when it cannot mount the Throne, may get into ſome ſtrong hold, and put the ſoul to much trouble e're it be beaten out again. Neither is it ſafe to acquieſce in ſome temporary truce with thy corruptions; bloody overthrows have been oft-times the events of a ceſſation of war for a ſeaſon: Joab <hi>blew the Trumpet, and all the people ſtood ſtill, and purſued after</hi> Iſrael <hi>no more, neither fought they any more,</hi> (i. e. for that time.) 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 28. And yet 'tis ſaid, <hi>ch. 3. 1. Now there was long war between the houſe of</hi> Saul <hi>and the houſe of</hi> David; <hi>but the houſe of</hi> David <hi>wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtronger and ſtronger, and the houſe of</hi> Saul <hi>waxed weaker and weaker:</hi> Sin may ſeem to yield, and trouble thy ſoul no more for a time, but carry it quietly with thee, as <hi>Joab</hi> did to <hi>Abner,</hi> and on a ſudden ſmite thee to the ground, though not to death, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 27. Nor is it enough that ſin be in chains, and under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint through the preſent ſtrength of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:132285:127"/> grace, unleſs it be hang'd up in chains as a dead malefactor.

What miſchief have chained Bears and Lions done when broken looſe? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, thy condition is not ſafe till thy ſin be dead: what <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jonathan, 1 Sam.</hi> 20. 31. may be applied to thy caſe; <hi>As long as the Son of</hi> Jeſſe <hi>liveth upon the ground thou ſhalt not be eſtabliſhed, nor thy Kingdom; wherefore now ſend and fetch him to me, for he ſhall ſurely dye:</hi> So can thy Soul obtain no ſtability in grace, but be always full of ups and downs, and have wars and changes againſt thee till thy corruptions be ſubdued.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. Firſt, Do nothing that might tend to ſtrengthen ſin. <hi>Rom. 13. 14. Make</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>luſts thereof:</hi> the word ſignifies a provident care
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:132285:128"/> of the fleſh, as men do to maintain themſelves and families: Don't take up your thoughts about it, how to feed and pleaſe your luſts: Never think to kill your corruptions while you ſecretly feed and maintain them: Many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their corruptions, and yet all the while feed and ſtrengthen them. There are ſeveral things that do contribute maintenance to mens luſts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Delightful Remembrance of former ſins, do wonderfully pleaſe a carnal heart, and ſtir up deſires to future ſins: As the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of former mercies is food to preſent faith. <hi>Pſal. 74. 14. Thou brakeſt the head of the Leviathan in pieces, and gaveſt him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderneſs. Iſrael</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the breaking of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s power, ſeriouſly thought on, was food to <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s faith in the wilderneſs: And ſuch are delightful remembrances of former ſins: When a perſon takes pleaſure to think and talk of his former evils; this doth feed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſires and hopes of ſin. When <hi>Paul</hi> would help on the <hi>Romans</hi> freedom from the ſervice of ſin, he labours to get their preſent thoughts of former ſins imbitter'd. <hi>Rom. 6. 21. What fruit had ye then in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed? for the end of theſe things is death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Pleaſing Imaginations, and fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of preſent or future ſins, do wonderfully ſtrengthen the habit of ſin. The Lord charges <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ſinful actions, as the product of their wicked thoughts. <hi>Iſa. 65. 2. Which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts.</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:132285:128"/> Sin firſt begins in the head, and ends in the feet; firſt working thoughts of ſin, and then actual works of ſin: The Devil doth uſually ſtrike the firſt fire on the tinder of mens thoughts, which afterwards burns in their hearts and lives. <hi>Jam. 1. 15. When luſt hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, it bringeth forth ſin, and ſin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth death.</hi> They that would avoid the birth of ſin in their lives muſt take heed of the conception of ſin in their pleaſing thoughts. They that would help on <hi>Babylon</hi>'s ruine, muſt prevent its propagation, and put a timely check to their growth; daſhing their little ones againſt the ſtone, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. 9. Leave <note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Sit nihil in te Babylonicum.</hi>
                     </note> not any thing that belongs to <hi>Babylon</hi> in thy ſoul, ſaith <hi>Hugo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Unbelief ſtrengthens luſt. <hi>Jer. 2. 25. But thou ſaidſt there is no hope; no, for I have loved ſtrangers, and after them I will go,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperatum eſt (ſcil.) cor.</hi> My heart deſpairs of help; I fear it will never be better, therefore I will go on in my way. Unbelief ſtrengthens luſt, and makes the ſoul a prey to it. 'Twas by unbelief <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell in the wilderneſs, both into ſin and ruine. And the Apoſtle cautions Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that they fall not by the ſame example of unbelief, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 11. 'Twas unbelieving de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding fears had almoſt turned up <hi>David</hi>'s heels, had not grace ſuccoured him by the Word, <hi>Pſal. 73. 2. But as for me, my feet were almoſt gone, my ſteps had well-nigh ſlipt.</hi> And whence came this weakneſs of grace, and ſtrength of corruption? why it was from the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:132285:129"/> apprehended proſperity of ſin and ſinners; and the ſucceſleſs iſſues of his profeſſion and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: <hi>Verſe 15. Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed my hands in innocency:</hi> If this be the fruit of my holineſs, then all my labour is in vain; 'tis to no purpoſe I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed God all this while, if wickedneſs ſhall carry it at laſt. O take heed of unbelief if ever you would get down your luſts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Preſumption ſecretly conveys in relief to ſin, and ſuccours it againſt all the ſieges of Word and Spirit. 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 10. Preſumptuous are they, ſelf-will'd.</hi> A preſumptuous ſoul is a ſelf-pleaſing ſoul, one that pertinaciouſly and wilfully ſeeks his own carnal contentments, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (as the word imports) he will boldly adventure on the moſt dangerous iſſues of ſin, ſo he may but gratifie his luſts, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his ſinful deſires; he fears no dangers, ſticks at no hardſhips, though God and his Word be againſt him; it makes the ſinner go againſt all warnings, threatnings, counſels, with hopes of ſucceſs. <hi>Numb. 14. 44. But they preſumed to go up to the hill top, verſe</hi> 42. The Lord forbad them to go, threatning his remove from them, and their ruine, if they durſt go up againſt his will. Nay, it was ſaid, <hi>The Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Lord; and Moſes went not out of the Camp;</hi> would not ſtir one foot with them in that wicked enterprize, yet they would go. O take heed of Preſumption, that does exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep up ſin, and pull down the ſinner.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Carnal ſecurity is a great friend to ſin, and contributes much to its advantage, when
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:132285:129"/> Chriſtians let down their watch, and lie down to ſlumber, then corruptions riſe up and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails over them. When the <hi>Amalekites</hi> were ſpread abroad upon all the Earth, eating, and drinking, and dancing, becauſe of all the great ſpoil that they had taken out of the Land of the <hi>Philiſtines, 1 Sam. 30. 16, 17. David</hi> fell upon them, and ſmote them from the twilight, even to the evening of the next day, and there eſcaped not a man of them ſave four hundred young men which rode upon Camels and fled. So 'tis with gracious ſouls after ſome great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, either ſome ſpecial priviledge enjoy'd, ſome ſpoils upon their luſts obtained, or token of God's favour received, they become ſecure, proud and careleſs, letting down their watch, expoſing themſelves to temptations, and ſoon become a prey to ſin and Satan. <hi>Jer. 48, 11. Moab hath been at eaſe from his youth, and he hath ſettled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from veſſel to veſſel, neither hath he gone into Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, therefore his taſte remaineth in him, and his ſcent is not changed.</hi> If you would have a change on your carnal hearts, take heed of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecurity in your hearts.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Self-indulgence helps to nouriſh ſin, when perſons are lovers of their own ſelves; ſeek to pleaſe, indulge and gratifie the deſires of carnal natural-ſelf; then luſts thrive in that ſoul. He that feaſts his body (ſaith <hi>Ephrem Syrus</hi>) and ſtarves his ſoul, is like him that feaſts his ſlave, and ſtarves his wife. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. Self-love leads the Van to all the iniquities and hypocriſies of the laſt times. O the troops of ſin that march
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:132285:130"/> under the banner of ſelf-love, and are ſecured by its conduct; hence ſelf-denial is the firſt ſtep to Chriſtianity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. You can never proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in your ſalvation-attempts, or decay in your ſoul-ruining luſts, till you learn to deny your ſelves in every part of it. Take heed of a ſelfiſh ſpirit, if you would be ſincere ſouls, and ſee the death of your luſts.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Opportunity favours ſin exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and helps to keep its hopes alive, and gives it occaſion for its enlargement. Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is the Midwife of luſt, and helps to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it of its inward conceptions and pregnant deſires: 'Twas opportunity that blew the coal of <hi>David</hi>'s luſt into a flame, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2. and midwiv'd out <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s pride, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39. 2. Had it not been for opportunity, <hi>Lot</hi> might have eſcaped the ſin of inceſt, as well as the ſufferings of <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 19. 30 to 37. and <hi>Judah</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs with his Daughter-in-law <hi>Tamar:</hi> 'Twas opportunity that expoſed <hi>Dinah</hi> to a rape, and <hi>Peter</hi> to the temptation of denying his Lord and Maſter. Take heed of adventuring into the way of temptation, and going to the borders of ſoul-danger; ſhun the occaſions of evil; turn aſide out of the way of ſnares, <hi>Prov. 1. 15. chap.</hi> 4. 14, 15. Temptation feeds corruption, enſnares and entangles the feet, and (as fewel) keeps in the fire of luſt. You may as ſafely ſuffer the ſparks to come near to gun-powder, as opportunity to corruption.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Impenitency in ſin ſtrengthens the habit of ſin. <hi>Jer. 8. 6. No man repented him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, what have I done? every
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:132285:130"/> one turned to his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the battel.</hi> They run on furiouſly in ſin, as the horſe doth into the battel, who runs till he ſweats (ſaith <hi>Theodoret.</hi>) So they have no end or ſatiety of ſin; and <note n="b" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Talis cogitatio cauſa fuit pertinacis nequitiae.</hi> Idem.</note> this impenitency in ſin was the cauſe of all their pertinacy in ſin. Impenitency hardens the heart, and heaps up ſin on ſin unto the day of wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. Take heed then of all thoſe things that may in the leaſt maintain and keep up ſin in your ſouls, as ever you think to bring it down: That's the firſt Advice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Secondly, Not onely ſhun what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might ſtrengthen ſin, but take heed you go not out in your own ſtrength againſt ſin, if ever you think to mortifie it: He that would mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie ſin, muſt be able to maſter Devils, <hi>Epheſ. 6. v.</hi> 12. But humane ſtrength is no match for Devils: If man in his pure eſtate were too weak for ſuch an adverſary, then much more impotent is impure and imperfect man: 'Tis not the woman, but the <hi>womans ſeed muſt bruiſe the Serpents head, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. The Saints victory is <hi>through him that hath loved them, and given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſacrifice to God for them, Rom. 16. 20. Rom. 8. 37. Epheſ.</hi> 5. 2. It muſt be his armour and arm too muſt bring ſalvation from ſpiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: <hi>Without me you can do nothing, John</hi> 15. 5. 'Tis this makes ſouls to fail in their attempts againſt ſin, that they ſet about it in a ſtrength inferiour to ſin. When <hi>Auguſtine</hi> after all his ſtrivings, vows and duties to bring down his corruptions, found them ſtill too hard for him?
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:132285:131"/> he heard a voice ſaying to him, <note n="c" place="bottom">
                        <hi>In te ſtas &amp; non ſtas.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Thou ſtandeſt in thy ſelf, and therefore thou doſt not ſtand:</hi> Whereupon he betook himſelf to prayer, and faith in the blood of Chriſt, and ſo got ſome victory over them. When the Exorciſts, <hi>Act. 19. v.</hi> 15, 16. went to caſt out Devils by the bare Name of Chriſt without the Power of Chriſt; both they and their attempts ſoon miſcarried: <hi>Jeſus I know, and Paul I know, but who are ye? and the man in whom the evil ſpirit was, leapt on them, and overcame them, and prevailed over them, ſo that they fled out of the houſe naked and wounded.</hi> Creature-ſtrength is too weak to maſter that enemy which hath the power of Hell to guard it. O go not out againſt ſin</p>
                  <p>In the ſtrength of your purpoſes and promiſes! <hi>Peter</hi> to his own coſt, found that too weak to ſecure him in an hour of temptation.</p>
                  <p>Go not out in the ſtrength of your frames and affections: How eaſily can Satan beat the Saints from theſe poſts, and caſt in a flood to drown their warmeſt affections! The <hi>Galatians</hi> that were high in frames and affections, and could talk of a bleſſedneſs, while ſpiritual, ſoon felt an alteration when they became carnal, <hi>Gal. 4. 15. chap.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
                  <p>Go not out in the ſtrength of your duties and performances; theſe are too weak without faith and the arm of Chriſt to charm theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and diſarm ſpiritual adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>Go not out in the ſtrength of your graces; theſe are not Chriſt, nor have an Almightineſs in them to bring down ſin and Satan: 'Tis not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:132285:131"/> grace in Believers, but grace in Chriſt, that is ſufficient to guard the ſoul from Satan's buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to reſcue it from his temptations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Direct.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Get the union between thy heart and ſin broken: The life of ſin lies in that union it hath with the heart; if that be broken, ſin dies; as a man then ceaſeth to live, when the union between the ſoul and body is diſſolved: Sin hath too great a part even in a Believer's heart, which moves for ſome reſpect and indulgence towards it: When the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened mind ſaies, Crucifie it, the carnal affections cry, <hi>Spare it, is it not a little one?</hi> And the heart (like the City of <hi>Iconium</hi> about <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>) is divided. <hi>Act. 14. 4. And the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the City was divided, and part held with the Jews, and part with the Apoſtles.</hi> So 'tis with the gracious ſoul; ſin hath too great a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in the carnal mind, which muſt be broken, or ſin will never die: Get the Spirit's intereſt in thy heart ſtrengthened, and ſins party weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened every day.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeven things that have a great ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to weaken the heart's union with ſin, and withdraw its affections from it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, An abiding ſenſe of the great Love of Chriſt towards it; that he ſhould pity him, when pitied of none, left of all; love him, when wallowing in his blood, and altogether unlove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in himſelf; love him, while an enemy to God, yea to his own ſoul; love him ſo as to give himſelf for him; to leave his Father's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and take up ſhame, yea taſte of death for
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:132285:132"/> him, love him, and paſs by others; call him, and leave others: the ſerious conſideration of this hath a great conſtraint on the gracious heart to hate ſin, which Chriſt ſo hates, and in love to the ſoul came to deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; A due apprehenſion of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable ſufferings of the Lord Jeſus, and all procur'd by ſin: <hi>He was deſpiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of men, a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief; he bore our griefs, and carried our ſorrows: he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities; he was oppreſſed and afflicted, and</hi> (that which gave an extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to all theſe ſorrows) <hi>it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, to put him to grief, and to make his ſoul an offering for ſin:</hi> This made the blows the heavier, that they came from a Father's hand: <hi>Had an enemy done it, it might have been eaſier born,</hi> (though his torments were unimaginable) <hi>but mine equal, mine acquaintance, my familiar friend, Pſal. 55. 12, 13. My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me, Matt.</hi> 27. 46? and all this the fruit of ſin: This makes a gracious ſoul to hate ſin, that hath been ſo cruel to his beſt and only friend.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; A believing ſight of the excellency and holineſs of Chriſt, hath a mighty power to draw off the heart from ſin: when the Prophet had got a view of the Lord in his holineſs, he hath preſently unlovely and troubleſome thoughts of ſin. <hi>Iſa. 6. ver.</hi> 1. to 7. <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the mid'ſt of a people of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean lips; for mine eyes have ſeen the King the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:132285:132"/> Lord of Hoſts:</hi> A ſight of Chriſt's holineſs will make ſin ſeem exceeding vile and loathſome, and the ſoul reſtleſs till delivered from it: 'Tis unacquaintedneſs with the holineſs and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perfections of Chriſt, that makes men fall in love with that deformed monſter, ſin: the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent glory of Chriſt is his grace; and the glory of the Saints is to be like him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. which is obtained through the immediate views of him. 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 2. When he appears, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is:</hi> The hope of which ſight, and glory, is ſoul-purifying now: <hi>ver. 3. And every man that hath this hope, purifieth himſelf, as he is pure:</hi> No ſooner had the Apoſtles a ſight of Chriſt's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious grace, but the next thing was <hi>a receiving from his fulneſs grace for grace,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. 16.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; A ſenſible ſight of the exceeding ſinfulneſs and evil of ſin will help to looſen this conjunction between the heart and ſin: when once <hi>Paul</hi> came to ſee the exceeding ſinfulneſs of ſin, and felt the killing fruits of it in his ſoul, his heart preſently came to be looſened from the ruling power of it. <hi>Rom. 7. 11. 13. That which I do, I allow not; what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</hi> The ſenſe of the ſhameful fruits of ſin was influential on the believing <hi>Romans</hi> towards their freedom from ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21. 22. Chriſtians, get your eye more intently fix'd on the curſed nature of ſin; how contrary to God; how like to Devils; how filthy loathſome and abominable: look upon the certain dreadful effects of ſin here, and to all eternity, if not removed; it hath
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:132285:133"/> brought death on the Son of God, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on the Sons of Men, bondage on the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, a curſe on every thing men do and enjoy; enmity againſt God, alienation from God, robbing him of his glory, croſſing his will, ſpoiling his works, grieving his ſpirit, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ſoul in duty, depriving it of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, expoſing it to judgment, neceſſitating it to evil, weakning his hopes, breaking his peace, oppoſing his grace, and endangering either the loſs, or leſſening of his glory; with other innumerable miſchiefs, injuries, cruelty and miſeries that follow the heels of it; with the great difficulty in its removal. <hi>I ſay;</hi> be more in the heart-affecting conſideration of theſe things, and you cannot chooſe, but with <hi>Paul,</hi> be weary of ſin, loath it, and long for a ſeparation from it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. How can ye love that knife that hath ſtabb'd your deareſt Friend, Father, Husband; yea, your own ſoul? How can you like that cloud and veil which ſtands between you and the Son of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and keeps theſe quickning warming beams from you, which would have cleared and ſtrengthned your heart? How can you hug the fetters, kiſs the walls and doors that impriſon your ſouls in bondage, and keep you from your beloved, and from the glorious liberty of the Sons of God? what pleaſure can you take in that Thief which ſtole your richeſt Jewels, and hath brought you to a morſel of bread?</p>
                  <p>5ly, Apprehenſion of that high dignity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ſtate to which grace hath advanc'd you, &amp; thoſe peculiar glorious priviledges which you
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:132285:133"/> are now inveſted with, hath a mighty influence on a gracious heart towards the abhorring of ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. Oh how unſutable are works of darkneſs to the children of light! how unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is vile rayment to them that dwell in Kings Houſes: A Swine's ſnout to a Saint's eye; thick clay, and defiling dirt on the hands, face, and heart of the heirs of glory, and children of the Kingdom: what an unlovely ſight is it to ſee Kings wallow in the mire as Swine; and ſuch who enjoy the priviledges of Angels, to do the work of Devils? Remember that thou art Son to a King, ſaid one to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and that will keep thee from baſe courſes. O Chriſtians! work in theſe thoughts upon the heart, and ſee whether there can be any room left for the works of the fleſh, or affections thereof.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly; Expectations of future glory will help you to deſpiſe that abominable thing, ſin: Can you rationally look for a Throne with your Beloved hereafter, and lodge in the boſome of your Idols and adulterous Lovers now? How can you think that head ſhall wear a Crown of glory with Chriſt, who is always plotting to put Crowns of Thorns on Chriſt's head now? To reap life everlaſting then, who ſow to the fleſh now? Do you hope for that time when you ſhall be uncloath'd of ſin? and can you make it your preſent work to put on ſin, hold faſt ſin? how inconſiſtent are deſires of ſin, with hopes of freedom? Chriſtians, don't deceive your ſouls, you cannot have ſure grounds of fellowſhip with God hereafter, and allow the leaſt communion between your hearts and ſin now.</p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:132285:134"/>
                  <p>Seventhly, Maintained union and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt will break heart-union and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with ſin: As heart-union with ſin will not admit of union and communion with God. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 17. Ephraim <hi>is joyned to Idols, let him alone:</hi> I will have no more to do with him; I'll leave, and remove from him: So union and communion with God in Chriſt, will not bear union with ſin. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 2. The Lord would not ſay <hi>Iſrael</hi> was his Wife, until her Whoredoms were put out of her ſight, and her Adulteries from between her breaſts: and no ſooner did ſhe return to a believing ſight of, and affectionate union with him, but ſhe preſently cries out, <hi>What have I to do with Idols any more, Hoſ.</hi> 14. 8? Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries oppoſe and weaken each other. <hi>Pſal. 97. 10. Ye that love the Lord, hate evil.</hi> Matth. 6. 24. <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters, either he will hate the one, and love the other; or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other: ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> Union with God is of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating nature. 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 17. He that is joyned to the Lord is one ſpirit,</hi> and cannot ſubſiſt without heart-ſeparation from ſin. 2 <hi>Cor 6. 16, 17. I will dwell in them, and walk in them;—wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Cleaving to Chriſt by Faith is the beſt way to the relinquiſhment of ſin. The ſoul that hath conſtant fellowſhip with Chriſt, will not care for other Lovers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. That's the third Direction: Get the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thy heart and ſin broken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. Fourthly, If you would mortifie
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:132285:134"/> ſin, ſtrike at the root of it, and get the body of this death deſtroyed, The life of the tree lies in the root; lop off all the branches, yet if the root be ſound, the tree lives, and the branches will ſprout out again, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 7, 8, 9. But if once the root be cut off, the whole tree dies and ceaſes from bringing forth fruit. So 'tis with ſin, if you ſet againſt this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar corruption, and let the body of death alone, not uſing means to weaken that, you will make but little of all your endeavours; when you have quieted one luſt, another riſes: 'Tis but to little purpoſe to lade away waters out of a ſhip, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you ſtop the leak that feeds them; while there is water in the Sea, it will be ſtill running in. They that will cure a diſeaſe, muſt get the cauſe removed: Original ſin is the ſource and fountain of all actual ſins; as that is weakened, ſo will the irruption of actual ſins be abated: The way to prevent the inroads and ſtranglings of a garriſon, is to begirt the Fort, and not onely keep them in, but ſcale and attach the ſtrong hold that ſecures them. <hi>This is the wiſdom of a Chriſtian</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Burroughs) that when he comes to labour againſt any corruption, he doth not ſpend his time ſo much againſt this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular corruption, but ſtrike at the body of corruption:—And hence is the reaſon that Chriſtians in a little time grow ſo much, and get ſo much power againſt their corruptions, whereas others are a long time before they get any power at all.</hi> 'Tis with a Believers heart, as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den overgrown with weeds; though the tops be often plucked off, while the mores and ſtrings
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:132285:135"/> abide under-ground, all they do to cleanſe it is labour in vain, they ſtill ſpring up afreſh: So is it with mens corruptions, till the root be more withered and weakened. Now to further this work:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Be deeply ſenſible of your ſinful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well as ſinful actions: This the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful complain moſtly of, even their ſinful natures. <hi>Iſa. 64. 6. We are all as an unclean thing, and our righteouſneſſes as filthy rags. Pſal. 51. 5. Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my Mother conceive me. Rom. 7. 24. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this death!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Apply the Death of Chriſt by faith to the whole body of ſin in you. Faith fetches virtue from a crucified Chriſt to dry up the bloody iſſue of ſin, <hi>Luke 8. 44. chap.</hi> 6. 19. This being the appointed way of God to bring down ſin. The foundation of a ſoul's redemption from ſin is laid in the Death of Chriſt. 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 24. Who bare our ſins for us in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to ſin, might live to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> This death to ſin is the effect of Chriſt's dying for ſin; this being the end of his Death, to redeem his people from all iniquity, <hi>Titus 2. v.</hi> 14. Chriſt's Death for ſin was not onely a pattern to Believers, but a medicine and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed means to deſtroy their ſin. <hi>Rom. 6. 6. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him; that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi> 'Twas by the Croſs of Chriſt that <hi>Paul</hi> was crucified to the world, and the world to him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. Carry over thy old
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:132285:135"/> man to the Croſs of Chriſt, and bury thy ſtrong luſts by faith in the grave of Chriſt, deriving virtue thence to kill thy ſin. Faith brings the ſoul into a fellowſhip with the Death of Chriſt, to receive the benefits and energy thereof; one of which benefits is a killing power on ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Improve Faith in the Promiſes. The death of ſin in Believers, is part of the New Covenant, and as ſure as pardon. <hi>Micah 7. 19. He will turn again, he will have compaſſion, he will ſubdue our iniquities, and thou wilt caſt all their ſins into the depth of the Sea, Mat.</hi> 1. 21. He ſhall ſave his people from their ſins, <hi>Rom. 6. v. 14. Deut.</hi> 30. 6. which promiſes are ſure to all the ſeed: The Lord Jeſus came on purpoſe to perform the promiſes to, and in his people. <hi>Rom. 15. 8. To redeem them from all iniquity, Titus</hi> 2. 14. And to deſtroy the works of the Devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. And ſaith in theſe Promiſes is ſoul-cleanſing, and ſin-ſubduing: Carry over thy unruly corruptions to Chriſt in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſue for juſtice upon them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Implore the conſtant help of the Spirit of Grace, both to diſcover, oppoſe and deſtroy thy corruptions: This work is too hard for fleſh and blood; nothing ſhort of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit can get a full conqueſt over ſin, and the power and wiles of Satan in thy ſoul: 'Tis <hi>through the Spirit Believers come to mortifie the deeds of the body, Rom. 8. 13. And by the ſpirit of judgment and burning, the Lord purges away the blood of Jeruſalem, Iſa. 4. 4. And by the Law of the Spirit of Life, we are made free from the Law of ſin and death, Rom.</hi> 8. 2. Take heed of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:132285:136"/> grieving and impeding the Spirit of Holineſs, by which his gracious, ſanctifying influences are ſuſpended, and thou be left to the weakneſſes of thy own ſpirit. Be much in prayer and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent cries for the Spirit's daily aſſiſtance in this great work.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Give no place to the leaſt motions of ſin, but maintain a conſtant war againſt the whole powers and body of ſin: The want of preventing care, timely oppoſition, and conſtant warfare againſt all the corruptions of fleſh and ſpirit, is one thing that lays gracious ſouls under the entanglements and prevalency of their luſts, <hi>James. 4. 17. 1 Theſ. 5. 2. Rom. 12. 9. We embrace</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>the deſires of our temptations upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith, not examining and withſtanding the firſt entrance of temptation, nor cruſhing the firſt motions of ſin.</hi> 'Tis eaſie to cruſh the Serpent's Egge, but dangerous conflicting with it when it becomes a Cockatrice. A rebellion may be with leſs ſtrength diſſipated at its firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, than ſuppreſſed when it hath gathered head, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. 29. The Devil's firſt aſſault (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) is violent; reſiſt that, and his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond will be weaker, and that being reſiſted alſo, he proves a coward. A Chriſtian's wiſdom and intereſt lies much in theſe two things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To take the ſtart of ſin, to ſtrike the firſt blow, to be in the field before it; yea to baracado up its way, and to fall in upon its quarters; to lay in proviſion againſt its very riſing; to fortifie the heart againſt the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſin, by applying threatnings and promiſes betimes, and furniſhing the heart with ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:132285:136"/> and ſcriptural antidotes againſt it: The neglect of this preventing care, deprives the ſoul of needful helps againſt its ſurpriſal, and ſo renders it weak againſt its firſt aſſaults. <hi>Arius</hi> at firſt (ſaith <hi>Hierom</hi>) was but a ſpark, but being not ſuppreſt betimes, he prov'd the incendiary of the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To proſecute the ſoul's victory over ſin: Sometimes the Lord gives his people power over a luſt, by a ſanctified affliction, or bleſſed ordinance, which victory, if purſued, might tend to the total ſubduing of it; but uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally we grow ſecure after ſuch ſucceſſes, and do not follow the victory, but give over too ſoon, as <hi>Joaſh</hi> in his-ſmiting on the ground, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 18, 19. The Prophet bid him ſhoot the arrows of the Lord's deliverance, and ſmite upon the ground; and 'tis ſaid, <hi>He ſmote thrice, and ſtayed; and the man of God was wroth with him; and ſaid, Thou ſhould'ſt have ſmitten five or ſix times, then hadſt thou ſmitten Syria till thou hadſt conſumed it.</hi> O what advantage might a Chriſtian get if he did but follow his victory over his corruptions, and not ſuffer them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit and gather ſtrength again! Give no reſt to thy luſts, nor ſpace for reviving; no not for a moment, but keep up thy warfare every day.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If you would further the death of ſin, keep up the life of grace: As the life of ſin weakens grace; ſo the life of grace keeps down and weakens ſin. <hi>Gal. 5. 16. Walk in the Spirit, and you ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh.</hi> Keep up grace, and ſin will down. <hi>As when the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:132285:137"/> houſe of David waxed ſtronger, the houſe of Saul waxed weaker, 2 Sam.</hi> 3. 1. 'Tis written of <hi>Ephrem Syrus,</hi> that though he was a man much given to paſſion in his youth; yet after he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a ſtrict courſe of life, he was never ſeen to be angry with any man. As you cannot get power over ſin, but by the Spirit of Grace; ſo you cannot keep the head over ſin, but by the Life of Grace: Get your graces ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and you will find your corruptions weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You muſt carry on Renovation in grace, and the inward work of Sanctification every day. <hi>Epheſ. 3. 23, 24. And be renewed in the ſpirit of your minds: And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true holineſs</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Schol.</note> After the work of Mortification, the Apoſtle preſſes Chriſtians to this work of Renovation, or Internal Holineſs; be renewed in the ſpirit of your minds (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in your minds by the Holy Spirit; the mind being put for the whole man, and internal facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul; both underſtanding, will, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and conſcience; all muſt be renewed by the Spirit, called the New Creature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. or Workmanſhip of Chriſt transformed after his own Image in righteouſneſs and true holineſs; and renewed in knowledge, <hi>Eph. 4. 24. Col.</hi> 3. 10. When the ſoul is truly regenerated, there is the ſtamp or eexmplar of Chriſt's holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, placed in the whole ſoul in truth; but in weak meaſures at firſt, which muſt be renewed
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:132285:137"/> or enlarged in the ſoul, till it comes to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the meaſure of the ſtature of Chriſt. Chriſtians at the firſt change, are compar'd to new born babes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. weak in grace, but under a natural diſpoſition and obligations to growth and encreaſes in this grace of God, both intenſively and extenſively: This is a Chriſtian's duty by divine command, and comports with the appointment of God in order to it, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. v. 18. 1 Pet. 2. 2. Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. 'Tis the way by which grace becomes glory, and is greatly neceſſary to perfect a ſoul's holineſs; that ſo he might come to his full ſtature and conformity to Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 16. Rom.</hi> 8. 29. And by the encreaſes of grace may be enabled to diſpatch all his duties, bear his burdens, and bear up under his temptations, that he might be capable to enjoy all his mercies, to glorifie the God of grace, and to be made meet for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God in glory: On all which accounts it becomes the Chriſtian's great concern to preſs after larger meaſures of grace every day; to grow up into him in faith and love, who is the head in all things, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 15. To grow down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in humility and ſelf-denial; to grow ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively in every part of holineſs, and greater enlargements in every grace; to wax ſtronger and ſtronger in the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus: <hi>Perfecting holineſs in the ſight of God; and preſſing more and more after the price of the High Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> The want of which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes of the Spirit, doth much obſcure the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt in Believers, cloud their evidences, and render them too weak for their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:132285:138"/> their growing tryals and duties. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, content not your ſelves with the truth of grace, without daily growth in grace. Improve your intereſt in the Reſurrection of Chriſt, by believing for the dailing quickening of your hearts, and raiſing of your affections to things above, and attracting your deſires and whole ſouls after God, grace and glory. Be much in internal ſoul-work, of heart ſearching, ſoul watching, divine contemplation, ſecret ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſoul breathings after God, and higher manifeſtations of his light, life and love.</p>
                  <p>Be conſtant in every appointment of God, publick and private; of prayer, reading, hearing, holy conference, that you may get nouriſhment thereby adminiſtred to your ſouls: Get under all the dews and ſhowres of grace for your fruitfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Be ſpiritual as well as frequent in exerciſing grace under the means of Grace; without this you cannot ſerve God acceptably, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. or receive from him who is the head nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your ſouls, but by theſe bands and joynts of faith and love, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. Formality eats out that ſap which ſhould make you green and flouriſhing: A dead, cold heart under the Word, can no more digeſt it to nutriment, than a dead body can concoct natural food.</p>
                  <p>Maintain hungring deſires after the word of grace, and appointed means to your ſpiritual growth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. Hungring after food argues a good digeſtion, and a ſound concoction furthers nouriſhment: Keep up warm affection to every way of God, living on Chriſt for all the good
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:132285:138"/> and bleſſing of them. <hi>Pſal. 84. 5. Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee, in whoſe heart are the ways of them; who paſſing through the Valley of</hi> Baca, <hi>make it a Well; the rain alſo filleth the Pools; they go from ſtrength to ſtrength, every one in</hi> Sion <hi>appearing before God.</hi> When <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi>'s heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord, 'tis ſaid he waxed great exceedingly, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 6. 12. Heart-enlargement in the ways of God is a notable help to ſoul-thrivings: Take this one thing more; be poor in ſpirit, if you would be rich in grace: Such are under the promiſe of being ſatisfied, of being guided in judgment, of encreaſing their joy; to ſuch he will give grace, and revivings. <hi>Humble ſouls</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Reyner;</hi> Excellency of Grace.</note> (ſaith one) <hi>are empty veſſels, which God will fill; are low plants, which God will make to grow: To be nothing in our own eyes, is the way to receive all good things, even grace in abundance from God; Pſal.</hi> 22. 26. and 25. 9. <hi>Iſa. 29. 19. Prov. 3. 34. Iſa.</hi> 57. 15.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; To keep your evidences for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven fair and legible, is another part of your Salvation-work: this will abundantly comfort you under all your tribulations, quicken you to a lively diſpatch of your duties, give you a humble boldneſs in your approaches to God; arm you againſt the fears of death, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to you an abundant entrance into the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Beware of quenching and grieving the Spirit of grace, by which its ſealing-work is hindered: Take heed of laying blots upon your
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:132285:139"/> evidences, by any allowed iniquity in your hearts, or unpurged defilement in your hands, which will weaken your confidence in the Lord, fill you with dejection and deſpondency of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and give your ſpiritual adverſary great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over your ſouls, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 10. 1 Joh. 5. 13. 2 Cor. 1. 12. 1 Cor. 15. 58. Heb. 10. 22. Job 19. 25, 26, 27. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
                  <p>Keep up your ſincerity and truth in the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, be often looking to the principle of your actions, that it be gracious; and to your ends in every thing you do, that they be pure, ſingly, and ultimately aiming at God, his will and glory in every duty, action and undertaking.</p>
                  <p>If you would evidence the truth of grace, you muſt be every day in the exerciſe of grace, and conſcionable endeavours to live up to known duties, exerciſing a conſcience void of offence towards God and man, not reſting in any meaſures of grace, but going on towards perfection, and aiming at greater enlargements in your ſouls and graces continually.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; Carry on all theſe natural, moral, and religious duties that concern others. This is the will of God, and part of your ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Matth. 5. 16. Let your light ſhine before men, and by your good works glorifie your Father which is in Heaven. 1 Cor. 10. 32. Walk unblamable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men, giving no offence to any, leſt the Goſpel be blamed.</hi> Phil. 1. 10. <hi>That you may be ſincere, and without offence to the day of Chriſt.</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 12. <hi>Having your converſation honeſt among thoſe you have to do with;</hi> dealing juſtly with all men, rendring to every man his due;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:132285:139"/> doing good to all, as opportunity ſerveth, <hi>Gal. 6. 10. Pſal.</hi> 35. 13. and be kind to the juſt and unjuſt, ſeeking the ſalvation of ſinners, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over them, praying for them, inſtructing of them; ſeeking by a humble, holy, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate carriage to win them over to the Lord Jeſus, who are not won by the word, <hi>Luke 19. 41. Pſal. 51. 13. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 1. Loving, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, doing good unto your greateſt enemies. Vertues ſeparated (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) are annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; equity without goodneſs, is ſeverity; and juſtice without piety, cruelty: 'Tis better to do good than to receive good. 'Twas ſaid of Mr. <hi>Hooker, That he was born for the good of many, but few born for the good of him:</hi> That you love, delight in, and do good to all Saints, as Saints, that carry the image of God on them. That you make conſcience of your relative du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both in your own houſes, and in the houſe of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 2. Walking within your own houſes with a perfect heart; to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at home as well as abroad; ſhewing the ſame ſpirit, zeal and affection to your Families as to others; doing your utmoſt to keep up the ſervice of God in your houſes, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and aſunder, morning and evening in prayer, and reading the word of God, <hi>Acts 10. 2. 9. Joſh. 24. 18. Pſal. 25. 10. Matth.</hi> 6. 6. That you faithfully diſcharge thoſe mutual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties you owe to each other, as Husband, Wife, Parents, Children, Maſters, Servants, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 22. to the end of <hi>chap.</hi> 6. To be meek, loving, peaceable in your words and carriages towards one another, giving that due reſpect as the place
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:132285:140"/> and relation calls for from each other: To be holy and profitable in your diſcourſes, ſeeking the ſpiritual welfare, edification and ſalvation of each others ſouls, as of your own, <hi>Deut. 11. 19. Prov. 22. 6. ch. 23. 13. Col.</hi> 3. 12, to 16. <hi>Heb. 12. 14. Gen.</hi> 18, 19. The want of which due and Chriſtian carriages in your houſes brings up an evil report on the ways of God, rendreth the truth of your grace queſtionable, hinders the gracious preſence of God with you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves his bleſſing from you, <hi>Eph. 4. 29. Rom.</hi> 11. 14. You whom grace hath priviledged with a place and name within the walls of God's houſe, do ſtand obliged to fellowſhip-duties of love, care and faithfulneſs to each other; <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering one another to provoke to love and good works,</hi> Joh. 15. 12. Heb. 10. 24. <hi>and eſteem each other better than your ſelves: To ſeek one anothers good as your own, ſerving each other in love, Phil. 2. 3. 1 Cor. 10. 24. 33. Gal.</hi> 5. 13. To ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with each other in affliction, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. and to be helpful to them in bearing their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, ſupplying their wants, comforting, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling, and ſupporting them in all their tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 3. viſiting the ſick and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, feeding the hungry, cloathing the naked, warning the unruly, admoniſhing the offenders, bearing one anothers infirmities, covering their weakneſſes, avoiding whatever might offend and injure each others ſouls, or leſſen their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or break the unity of ſpirit and bond of peace between them; but by a ſweet, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-ſelf denying, and faithful carriage, to engage the heart to each other, praying for the whole
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:132285:140"/> body, and every member: To be gracious and ſpiritual in all your communion and converſes, ſeeking the proſperity of <hi>Sion,</hi> rejoycing in each others graces and good, as in your own; doing all you may towards their comfort and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Mat. 25. 42. Acts 20. 35. 1 Joh. 3. 17. Rom.</hi> 15. 1. and 16. 17. <hi>Lev. 19. 10. 2 Cor. 12. 20. Col. 4. 6. Phil. 2. 17, 18. Tit. 2. 12. 2 Cor. 13. 7. Pſal. 15. 2. Col.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
                  <p>In your Callings, commerce and dealings with men, to be juſt, honeſt, and faithful, doing as you would be done unto, not defrauding one another, but ſpeaking the truth in all your bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainings, and performing your promiſes, though to your hurt. This is a conſiderable part of your heavenly Trade, and that wherein the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Religion doth eminently lye; the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and glorifying of God, the good of others, the propagation of the Goſpel, the peace and ſalvation of your own fouls, even in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcharge of theſe natural, moral, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duties you owe unto others.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt part of heavenly work; work of a heavenly nature as well as manner, both with reſpect to God, our own ſouls, and others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another part of heavenly work is to do earthly things in an heavenly manner: Though the things of the World are of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature from things above, yet when rightly managed, they are ſubſervient to them, and come within the compaſs of this Heavenly Trade: To which three things are needful.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Then is earthly work part of your Heavenly Trade, when you tranſact it by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly rules; every Science hath its Maxims; diſtinct Governments have their diſtinct Laws: So hath every Trade its rules, principles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions by which it is carried on. Earthly Traders have their rules and methods by which they manage their buſineſſes, as may moſt comport with the end they propoſe, and the advance of their own earthly intereſts; and ſo 'tis with heavenly Traders, though they have to do with earthly things, yet they muſt act about them by heavenly rules.</p>

                     <head>Now there are ten rules which heavenly Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants muſt obſerve in the management of their earthly affairs.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 1. Firſt, Be ſure the matter of your employments be good, that your Callings be lawful, and the things you do be juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in the ſight of God: Evil things can never be well done: meddle not with prohibited goods; do nothing that either in its nature, uſe, or by divine Law becomes evil, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 7. Phil. 4. 8. Eph.</hi> 4. 28. Let your Callings be <note n="a" place="bottom">

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:132285:141"/> advantage, but for the ſervice and good of others: <hi>For no man liveth to himſelf, Rom.</hi> 14. 7. Such a calling as hath God for its Author <note n="m" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Opera Deo placere non poſſunt ſi vitae suae inſtitutum non eſt a Deo.</hi> Frid. Baldm.</note> being according to Scripture; and <hi>hath God for its Teacher</hi> 
                        <note n="n" place="bottom">The works of that calling cannot pleaſe God, where the calling it ſelf is not of God.</note> (ſaith <hi>Fenner) Iſa.</hi> 28. 26. And <hi>as a man can manage with peace of conſcience, and be aſſur'd his work doth pleaſe God, and he can pray for a bleſſing upon it;</hi> which they cannot do who ſet on employments that tend to nouriſh vice and wickedneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14.</p>
                     <p>That your Recreations alſo be lawful; ſuch as are free from ſcandal and temptation, uſed by, and with perſons fearing God, and ſuch as have a tendency to refreſh the mind and body, the better diſpoſing it to its neceſſary duties, being ſparingly and wiſely uſed, ſo as to be no occaſion of evil to others, and religiouſly entred on by ſeeking to God for a right management of it, and bleſſing on it. Such actions as come not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe characters, are not becoming Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who muſt give an account to God for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vain word, much more for idle actions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 36. 'Tis part of that which will trouble ſouls when their ſins are bearing on them; <hi>that they have inherited lies, vanities, and things wherein is no profit, Jer.</hi> 16. 19. Saints ſhould be working nothing but what hath a good in it: <hi>Working with his hands the things that are good, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 28. and which can bring ſome glory to God: <hi>Whatſoever you do</hi> (of which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:132285:142"/> is a part) <hi>do all to the glory of God, 1 Cor.</hi> 10, 31. But what good to the body, foul or eſtate; what glory to God; what peace to conſcience in the day of Chriſt, can be found in carnal ſports, ſcandalous plaies, cards, dice, laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious dancings, and the like? which are the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of chambering and wantonneſs, things wherein is little praiſe, virtue, or good report; but rather the ſpots of Chriſtianity, and bane of piety, which tend to debauch the affections, to deaden the conſcience, to nouriſh wantonneſs, and ſeed a fleſhly carnal mind, the end of which is death, <hi>Rom. 13. 13. Phil. 4. 8. Jude v. 12. 2 Pet. 2. 18. Rom. 8. 6. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace.</hi> It is a double content to a generous and well diſpoſed nature, when he doth good for his pleaſure. <hi>Games of hazard</hi> (ſaith<note place="margin">

Games that conſiſt in dexterity of body or mind, are much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before theſe: Cheſs will ſharpen the wit, but buſie it over much, and toil the ſpirits, inſtead of recreating them, which is the proper uſe of play: Of all gaming, the leſs the better; and when it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders the paſſions, the leaſt is too much. He that ventures much money at play, ventures with it not onely the tranquillity of his mind; but makes a certain loſs of it whatever becomes of the money</hi>—Squandring away of money in play, is not the way to make friends of that unrighteous Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that receive a man into everlaſting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:132285:142"/> but an enemy rather that will turn him out of his temporal habitation; it is the way to loſe both Earth and Heaven: So then, whether we win or loſe, we commit robbery; for if we rob not our adverſaries, we rob our ſelves, our families, and God: We may add this alſo; ſuch unprofitable Recreations devour that precious treaſure of irrecoverable, unvaluable, yea ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation-time; and uſeth thoſe hours in poſting to Hell, which are too much neglected for haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to Heaven. O how careful then ſhould ſouls that profeſs heavenly hopes be of their earthly work, that it be ſuch as may conduce to their accompliſhment of them!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 2. Secondly, Set upon earthly things in their proper place and order: <hi>Seek firſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the righteouſneſs thereof, and all theſe things ſhall be added to you,</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="bottom">

                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. Let God have the uppermoſt Throne in your hearts, the fore-foot in your walk, the firſt ſtroke in your work; give heavenly things the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, both in eſtimation, affection and time, as things of greateſt worth, and to which you are chiefly obliged: That's the due order and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of heavenly Traders, to begin every day and work with God; ſerve God firſt, and then your ſelves: Set apart ſome time for religious duties, before you ſet upon earthly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Men will not go abroad into unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom air faſting: The things of this world have a contagious breath in them: Break your faſt with God every morning, before you adventure on heart-enſnaring buſineſſes: Labour with God

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote your hearts with divine cordials every morning, before you get into the Peſt-houſe of this world, and let ſomething of Scripture lye neareſt thy ſoul for counſel, comfort, quickening every day: He (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) that hath taſted the ſweetneſs of Divine love, will not care for temporal ſweetneſs. Meddle not with the thorns of this world, till you have fenced your hearts and hands by prayer, and the ſword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: 'Tis more haſte than good ſpeed to run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world before you have ſpoken with God: The lawful way to earthly employments lies by Heavens gates. Chriſtians, God will ſue you for treſpaſſes if you take any other way to your trades and employments in the world, than his preſcribed way of religious duties. Beſides, you have need of God's eye and hand in every thing you do: You know not the ſnares and deaths that lye in your employments, and the dangers you are ſubject to in every ſtep you go, and in every thing you do: You may go forth in the morning, and never return more; ſome have died as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, with meat in their mouths; others have fal'n down dead in their work, broke their necks in a journey, been found dead in the way: O ſet on earthly work in God's way; go not about the world till you have been with God, and ſecur'd your All in his hands.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rule</hi> 3. Thirdly, Keep your earthly buſineſs within the bounds of due time. He that hath
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:132285:143"/> allotted you your work, hath allotted you your time for it: it conſiſts not with man's ſtate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and intereſt, to be arbitrary in any thing, but to walk by rule. <hi>There is a time for every thing under the Sun, Eccleſ. 3. 1. A time for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry purpoſe, and for every work, verſe 17. Job</hi> 7. 1. As there is an appointed time to man on earth; ſo there is an appointed time to man for earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things: He that hath ſet bounds to the world, hath not left worldly employments without bounds, but hath fixed mens earthly affairs within their proper ſeaſon. <hi>Pſal. 104. 23. Man goeth forth to his work and to his labour until the evening.</hi> The Pſalmiſt acknowledges here the power and providence of God in ſetting bounds to his creatures; bounds to the Sun and Moon. <hi>Verſe 19. He appointed the Moon for ſeaſons, and the Sun knoweth his going down:</hi> Bounds to the day and night. <hi>Verſe 20. Thou makeſt darkneſs, and it is night:</hi> he limits the labours of wild beaſts and men; the beaſts have their preying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time confined to the night. <hi>Verſe 20. 22. And it is night wherein all the beaſts of the foreſt do creep forth; the Sun riſeth, they gather themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and lay them down in their dens.</hi> Men have their working-time allotted in the day: <hi>Man goeth forth to his work and labour until the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> that is, to the end of their working-day, which conſiſted among the <hi>Jews</hi> of twelve hours. <hi>John 11. 9. Are there not twelve hours in the day?</hi> the uſual time for men to diſpatch their earthly work in. <hi>The Lord would not</hi>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:132285:144"/> 
                        <hi>Muſculus) have mens labours drawn out ſo far as to wear out their ſtrength, but hath ſet bounds to it.</hi> As the Lord would not have the world to take up mens hearts; ſo he would not have it to eat out their time, or encroach on theſe ſeaſons that are due to greater concerns. God, Nature, Grace, thy own ſoul, and the ſpiritual good of others, have their claims, as well as thy earthly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to this little inch of this time. O conſume not thy precious day on things that are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and neglect thy opportunities for things eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: do not enſlave thy body beyond thy beaſts, which have their times of reſt; nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt that ſtrength which better things call for, upon an empty periſhing world. Exceſſive la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours beyond their due time, do argue either too much deſire of theſe things, or too little faith in God, and are reprov'd by the Lord as the vanity and practice of them, who are not his beloved ones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. 2. 'Tis lamentable to ſee ſuch as would be thought the heirs of Heaven, ſo exceſſively taken up in enlarging their poſſeſſions on earth; engroſſing all their time early and late, about their earthly affairs, leaving nothing but a few unſerviceable minutes for God and their ſouls. O Chriſtians! Keep the ſtream of your earthly affections and labours within the banks of allowed time; rob not God of his time of ſpecial ſervice; nor nature of her time of needful reſt and refreſhment: nor thy own or others ſouls of time for their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual concerns, for ſuch poor periſhing things: Shew charity to thy redeemed body; make it not a drudge to thy earthly luſts: Man is too
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:132285:144"/> noble a creature to be a vaſſal to this world: 'Tis a ſad ſpectacle to ſee the <hi>Nazarites</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> with their heads ſhaven, and their eyes pluckt out to grind in the world's mill, till they pluck down the houſe about their ears, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 21. How do men macerate their bodies, and ſtarve their ſouls, onely to help them with ſupplies in their paſſage to the grave, and all the while neglect the work of God, and their ſouls, leaving the reliques of their waſted ſtrength, and the world's refuſe, for the ſervice of an immortal God. This is not to follow earthly things by heavenly Rule.</p>

Fourthly, Be diligent in the uſe of your working time: take heed you waſte it not upon impertinencies, or by needleſs diverſions, or by idleneſs, and unfaithfulneſs in your work: this is a ſin againſt both Law and Goſpel, which requires diligence and faithfulneſs in mens earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly callings: Labour and calling-work was man's duty before his fall. <hi>Gen. 2. 15, The Lord God took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dreſs it, and to keep it:</hi> And after the fall, painful labour was injoyn'd and inflicted as a puniſhment of his ſin. <hi>Gen. 3. 19, In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread, until thou return to the ground.</hi> This duty of bodily labour in mens Callings, is of equal ſanction and regard with the duties of Gods Worſhip, being inſerted in a poſitive Law, and as that which is neceſſary to the ſanctifying of God in Sabbaths. <hi>Exod. 29. 9, 10, Six days ſhalt thou labour, and do all thy work, but on the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt not do any work:

Caſting all your care on God, for he careth for you.</hi> Depend not on your wiſdom, labour or ſucceſs in your em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, but upon the promiſe, love and care of God for you: If the Lord bleſſeth your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, don't you bleſs your ſelves in it: See an emptineſs in all your abundance, and ſhortneſs in theſe to anſwer your many wants. God can ſoon make a hole in your money-bags, blow on your encreaſe, turn your proſperity into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and make your expected comforts as the dream of a night viſion.

A mortified Saint wonders that a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional immortal Soul can ſee ſuch worth in riches, pleaſures, honours, and poor periſhing things of this life, which to him are nothing; he can eaſily part with all at the Lord's bidding.

                        <hi>Rule</hi> 10. Laſtly, Do all your work within the view of death, judgment, and eternity: tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:132285:149"/> the employments of every day, as dying perſons, who are leaving this World, and liable to a remove every moment: How would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſerious thoughts of a near approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing end wonderfully check mens greedy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of this World, and help to keep their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in a conſiſtency with their accounts.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Then do you your earthly work in an heavenly manner, when you do it with an heavenly heart: As is the heart, ſo is the action in God's account: the Lord was much pleaſed that it was in <hi>David</hi>'s heart to build him an Houſe, though he never did it, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 18. and diſpleaſed with all that <hi>Iſrael</hi> did in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>becauſe their heart was not right with him, Pſal. 78. 37. Iſrael</hi> did many good works, <hi>they ſought him, they returned and enquired early after God, they remembred that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer, ver.</hi> 34, 35. but all this was nothing in God's eſteem, becauſe their heart was not upright in it; they had an earthly, carnal, ſelfiſh, backſliding heart in all they did. If thy heart be heavenly, though thy work be earthly, yet it puts an excellency on it; but if thy work be heavenly, and thy heart earthly, God doth reject and deſpiſe it: the heart is the root of every action, and if the root be good, the fruit will be good alſo, <hi>Mat.</hi>
                        <pb n="267" facs="tcp:132285:150"/> 12. 33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. If the fountain be ſweet, the ſtreams will be ſweet alſo; and if thy heart be heavenly, thy work is heavenly: A heavenly heart, like the Bee, turns all it doth to heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſes: when the Lord Jeſus had put his hand upon the Spouſes heart, and left ſome myrrh upon her bowels, preſently her hands dropped myrrh, and her fingers ſweet ſmelling myrrh, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 4, 5.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Firſt, A heavenly heart is a heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned to ſee heavenly things; a heart beam'd over with heavenly light, to diſcern things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible: An earthly heart is a dark heart, it ſees nothing in God, his Word and Works, ſo as to draw up his heart to Heaven: an earthly heart ſees nothing but earth in heavenly things; and an heavenly heart ſees Heaven in earthly things. The Patriarchs ſaw the heavenly City in their earthly Countrey, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13, 14, 16. They ſaw the promiſes (that is, the things promiſed) afar off, and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers on earth, they ſought a Countrey, deſired a better Countrey, that is an heavenly; and all that as the product of their heavenly ſight, they ſaw heavenly things in earthly: <hi>Abraham</hi> had an heavenly eye to ſee Chriſt's day, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 5, 6. and <hi>Moſes</hi> a heavenly eye to ſee him who is inviſible, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 27. A heavenly heart doth
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:132285:151"/> not only ſee heavenly things, but ſees an infinite worth and excellency in them: it ſees them to be the beſt things; it ſees a greater glory and deſirableneſs in things above, in one glance of his eye, in one day within his Courts, in one hours communion with him, than in all the World beſides: <hi>Mary</hi> ſaw more advantage in ſitting at Chriſt's feet, than in the many things <hi>Martha</hi>'s heart was taken up about, <hi>Luke 10. 41, 42. Curſed be that man</hi> (ſaith the noble Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Galeacius) that accounts not one hours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt above all the World.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, A heavenly heart is a heart that ſavours heavenly things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5. Nothing goes down ſo ſweet with a heavenly heart as heavenly things, <hi>every thing rejoyces in its like:</hi> An earthly heart delights in earthly things; the Merchant in his Trade, the Husband-man in his Field, Houſes, Husbandry, and fruits of the earth; the voluptuous man in his pleaſures; as he that ſold his City for a draught of water; crying out when he had done, O that for ſo ſhort a pleaſure, of a King I ſhould be made a Slave! The proud man in his greatneſs, <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babylon <hi>that I have built, for the houſe of the Kingdom? Dan.</hi> 4. 30. So doth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly heart reliſh greateſt ſweetneſs in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things: <hi>How ſweet are thy words to my taſte? yea ſweeter than honey to my mouth,</hi> Pſal. 119. 103. <hi>His fruit was ſweet to my taſte; his mouth is moſt ſweet,</hi> Cant. 2. 3. and 5. 16. <hi>My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet,</hi> Pſal. 104. 34. <hi>We took ſweet counſel together,</hi> Pſal. 55. 14. <hi>We talked of the myſteries of godlineſs</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ainſworth) of the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:132285:151"/> exerciſes of Religion;</hi> (ſaith another) which I ſuppoſe the Prophet meaneth by going into the Houſe of God, as companions conſulting (as it were) how they might prepare themſelves to his ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A heavenly heart is a heart that longs and deſires after heavenly things: <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none that I can deſire on Earth in compariſon of thee, Pſal. 73. 25. When ſhall I come and appear before God? My ſoul thirſteth for thee; my fleſh longeth for thee, in a dry and thirſty land where no water is, to ſee thy power and glory, as I have ſeen thee in the Sanctuary, Pſal. 43. 2. Pſal. 63. 1, 2. My ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord; my heart and my fleſh cryeth out for the living God, Pſal.</hi> 84. 2. Deſires are the natural motions of the heart, and <hi>the beſt character, and trueſt lineaments</hi> (ſaith one (<hi>y</hi>))<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reynold</hi>'s Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Paſſion.</note> 
                        <hi>that can be drawn of the minds of men. Practices may be overrul'd by ends; but deſires are alwaies genuine and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural: Hence good men have had moſt confidence in approving themſelves to God, by their affections, and the inward longings of their ſouls after him, as being the pureſt and moſt unfeigned iſſues of love, and ſuch as have leaſt proximity and danger from forein and ſecular ends.</hi> It is an unqueſtionable evidence of ſouls riſen with Chriſt, and receiving the ſtamp of Heaven on the heart, to ſet their affections on things above: Heavenly deſires are the natural breathings of a gracious heart, which can as well live without them, as a man without breathing; a ceſſation of ſpiritual
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:132285:152"/> deſires, argues ſoul-ſwooning, or ſpiritual death.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, A heavenly heart is known by its heavenly thoughts; it will be much think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of heavenly things: As is the heart, ſo are the thoughts uſually. <hi>For as he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſo is he, Prov.</hi> 23. 7. The thoughts are the firſt-born of the heart, and ſtrength of the ſoul, and as natural iſſues of the mind, as beams are of the Sun; if the heart be evil, the thoughts will be evil; if the heart be good, the thoughts will ordinarily be good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 19. further than corruptions or temptations hinder, <hi>Jer. 4. v.</hi> 14. If your hearts be heavenly, ſo will your deſigned, habitual and well-pleaſing thoughts be. <hi>They that are ſpiritual, will mind the things of the Spirit, Rom.</hi> 8. 5. Try your hearts by your ordinary, quiet and delightful thoughts: Are vain, earthly thoughts your trouble, and holy thoughts your delight?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, A heavenly heart will be full of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly projects; ſuch a heart will be driving de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for Heaven; his conſultations, enquiries and ſtudies, will be how to carry on and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote heavenly intereſts. <hi>Titus 3. 8. This is a faithful ſaying, and theſe things I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, cum ratione &amp; concilio exerceri;</hi> the word is, might ſtudy, deviſe, and beat their brains how they might do good: That's the temper of earthly hearts alſo; they will be plotting and contriving waies and means how to advance earthly intereſts. <hi>Phil. 3. 19. Who mind
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:132285:152"/> earthly things, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, Zanchy,</hi> whoſe thoughts are in the earth (as the <hi>Syriack</hi> renders it,) that is, they are wholly taken up about earthly things: So 'tis with a heavenly heart, it is taken up about the things of Heaven; it laies holy plots, how to keep down the world and corruption in the ſoul, and how to make the moſt of all it hath and doth for Heaven, to ſecure his intereſt, and enlarge his poſſeſſion above: So far as the heart is heavenly, ſo far is it deſigning for Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, A heavenly heart is acted and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by heavenly motives and arguments; there is nothing ſways more with a heavenly ſpirit than reaſons drawn from heavenly things, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly pleaſures, heavenly honours, heavenly treaſures will do more with a heavenly heart than any arguments drawn from things of this life. The nature of the heart is much known by the motives that are moſt potent with it: A carnal heart is byaſſed by carnal things: <hi>Who will ſhew us any good? Pſal.</hi> 4. 6. But a ſpiritual heart with ſpiritual things: <hi>Lord lift up thou the light of thy countenance upon us: Lot</hi> will chooſe the plains of <hi>Sodom;</hi> but <hi>Abraham</hi> will prefer walks with God, though in a Wilderneſs. <hi>David</hi> values his lot, by what it hath of God in it, and counts that moſt pleaſant and rich which helps him to moſt of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 5, 6. Tell an heavenly heart how he may be rich, great and comfortable in the World, and it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies nothing: but tell him how he may pitch his Tent neareſt to the Ark and enjoy moſt of God, how he may keep peace and holineſs
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:132285:153"/> within, and order his converſation aright to pleaſe God, and you will ſooner win ſuch a heart, than by all the choiceſt propoſals of this life. <hi>Wherewithal ſhall a young man cleanſe his way?</hi> Pſal. 119. 9. <hi>Who ſhall abide in thy taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle?</hi> Pſal. 15. 1. <hi>Who will riſe up for me againſt evil doers?</hi> Pſal. 94. 16. <hi>How might I do to get a better heart? to be more rich towards God? Oh that one would give me drink of the waters of the Well of</hi> Bethlehem! 2 Sam. 23. 15. <hi>How might I do for ſome fore-taſtes of the rivers of pleaſure at the right-hand of God? and to eat of the tree of life in the mid'ſt of the Paradiſe of God, Rev.</hi> 2. 7. Theſe are the moſt taking things with an heavenly ſoul; his choice, his delights and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent intereſts lie on the other ſide of this World, even within the borders of <hi>Immanuel</hi>'s Land.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, A heavenly heart is a heart that lives upon heavenly things, and is maintained by proviſions fetch'd from Heaven, nouriſhed up in the words of Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6. deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. My meat and drink is to do the will of him that ſent me, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 34. Earthly hearts are maintained by earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; like the Crows, they live on carrion; but heavenly hearts live upon heavenly things, they feed on the fineſt Wheat; and, like the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Bird, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>le malim, that lives upon the dew, and of the juice of Flowers and Roſes;</hi> heavenly ſouls proſper beſt on heavenly pulſe and water: <hi>Give me underſtanding and I ſhall live, Pſal.</hi> 119. 144.</p>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:132285:153"/>
                     <p>Eightly, A heavenly heart walks by heavenly Rules; 'tis led by the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. All the threatnings of men cannot upon choice bow him from his path-way of duty, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10. nor the reaſon or allurements of men draw him with full conſent into the way of ſin, <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 18. Whatever comes of it he is at a point to keep the commands of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 106. It chuſes to be governed by heavenly Laws. <hi>And we will walk in his paths, Iſa. 2. 3. As for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lrrd, Joſh.</hi> 24. 15. Such a ſoul is eaſily perſwaded by the evidence of truth; and will hear what the Spirit ſaies: <hi>A little child ſhall lead him, Iſa.</hi> 61. 6.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Then are earthly things done in an heavenly manner, when done to heavenly ends and purpoſes; to obey, pleaſe and honour God; when a perſon can approve his heart to an all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing eye, that the great and chief end for which he takes up this or that calling, ſets on any em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, is in ſubordinacy to theſe great ends, not to pleaſe men, to gratifie his own luſts, to grow great in the world, to enjoy pleaſure, eaſe, reputation, and intereſt here, but out of obedience to the Maker, Redeemer and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this world, that God in all things might have his will and glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11. This is the ultimate end of all Gods works, and ſhould be of man's alſo. All employments run out of their proper chanel, if they tend not to this Ocean of divine glory: As God is the <hi>Alpha,</hi> ſo he muſt be the <hi>Omega</hi> of every action; the firſt cauſe muſt be the laſt end. God hath made all things for himſelf, <hi>Prov. 16. 4. To him belongs the iſſues</hi>
                        <pb n="274" facs="tcp:132285:154"/> (as from death, ſo) <hi>of life, Pſal.</hi> 68. 20. Nothing is further good, than it anſwers God's end; earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ends ſpoil heavenly work, and heavenly ends puts an excellency on earthly work. Chriſtians, be careful of your ends in all you do: 'Tis not enough to do things that are right, if you are not upright in them: That's unſanctified work which hath not holy aims, and God for its laſt end. To follow your callings, that you might live honeſtly in the ſight of men; that you might provide for your own, and have a competency in the world to carry you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably through it, is lawful, as ſubordinate ſecondary ends, but not as your chief and laſt end, to which all your actions muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; that muſt be ſingly and ſupremely the pleaſing and honouring of God as your higheſt end.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Another part of this Heavenly Trade is driven on &amp; maintain'd in heavenly thoughts: Thoughts are the embrio and conception of actions, which alſo come under the cogniſance and government of Religion. 'Tis a common, but carnal principle, and falſe aſſertion, that <hi>thoughts are free:</hi> They are free indeed from the inſpection of men, but not from the eye and judgment of God, who ſearcheth the hearts, and weigheth the ſpirits, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 10. and will bring every ſecret thing into judgment, <hi>Eccleſ. 12. 14. Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>The thoughts of fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſin, Prov. 16. 2. Prov.</hi> 24. 9. And <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that the thoughts of the heart need forgiveneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 22. not onely ſinful actions, but ſinful thoughts are forbidden, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 9.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:132285:154"/> and the very thoughts as well as words and lives of Chriſtians, are to be brought under the obedience of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. The Idea and platform of every conſiderate action, is firſt drawn in the mind and inward thoughts: No work is rightly done that wants praevious thoughts and conſideration. <hi>Prov. 16. 9. A man's heart deviſeth his way;</hi> he weighs, conſiders and deliberates about the way he is to go in, and the courſe of life he is to drive; he counts the time, coſt, and every thing that muſt go to his work. <hi>Prov. 31. 16. She conſidereth a field and buyeth it.</hi> So 'tis in this Heavenly Trade; there muſt be deviſing of the way, ſerious thoughts and conſiderations, how to manage it to beſt advantage; how to get in, and put off wiſdom's goods; how to ſtrengthen grace, to diſpatch duty, to obtain the favour of God, and dwell in his preſence; how to improve mercy, and how to enſure glory. The Heavenly Trade can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be carried on without heavenly thoughts. Inward working thoughts about God and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, are of wonderful uſe to further a holy life: They warm and chear the heart under troubles, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 19. engage and fix it on God, and render his preſence deſirable: Heavenly thoughts fire the heart, and inflame it to holy actions, <hi>Pſal. 139. 17. Pſal.</hi> 39. 3. and are a choice preſervative againſt ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 4. 'Tis greatly uſeful to encreaſe knowledge, and attain to deep wiſdom and underſtanding. <hi>Dan. 14. 4. Many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall encreaſe:</hi> That is, their thoughts ſhall be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on truth, buſily employed to find out the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:132285:155"/> meaning of the word, <hi>looking on one ſide, and on the other ſide</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Fenner</hi>) and by this means ſhall come to a great thriving in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Men will never be religious to purpoſe, or be their crafts-maſters in this Heavenly Trade, till they be more ſpiritual and heavenly in their thoughts. Chriſtians, make conſcience of your thoughts; <hi>they muſt come to judgment;</hi> waſh your hearts from whence they come, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14. and watch your thoughts whither they go; check your thoughts when they begin to wander; quicken your thoughts when flat; fix your thoughts when floating; ſpiritualize them when carnal; exerciſe them when ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; ſet them on their proper and profitable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and hold them to their work in divine and heavenly meditation every day, which is part of your Heavenly Trade, and hath a mighty tendency to ſoul-enriching, <hi>Pſal. 4. 4. Pſal. 63. 4. Pſal. 104. 34. Gen. 24. 63. Pſal. 1. 2. Pſal. 77. 12. Pſal.</hi> 139. 8.</p>
                     <p>Meditation is a calling in the thoughts from its ſtraglings and undue employments, fixing them on, and holding them to their peculiar work: 'Tis the travel of the mind in the ſearch of ſome ſpiritual good, from ſuch things as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and providence lay before it; it weighs things and actions in the ballance of truth; it turns things up-ſide down, and looks on both ſides, and through them, that it may take a right eſtimate of them: 'Tis the running to and fro of the cogitations to encreaſe knowledge, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 4. Meditation ſifts things and truths, to divide the flower from the bran, and truth
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:132285:155"/> from errours; it helps to a clearer and more ſenſible view of truth and excellency; with the Chymiſt, it extracts the ſpirits and quinteſſence of things; it warms the heart, and fires the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, raiſes deſires, engages the will, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens and enlivens the conſcience, and helps to feed the ſoul on divine truths, to feaſt it with divine love; it draws nouriſhment from ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ſweetneſs from promiſes, inſtructions from the creature, and good from providences. Without Meditation a perſon cannot receive the good that's offer'd to him, or do the good that is required of him. The Word preached doth not profit hearers, for want of Meditation to digeſt it; threatnings, promiſes, counſels, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, don't affect the ſoul, or effect their errand and meſſage, for want of a ſerious and ſettled conſideration of them. O what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit might Chriſtians get to their ſouls, were more time ſpent every day in right Meditation! Believer, charge thy heart with this duty of daily Meditation, which is as needful as Prayer, Reading, and any acts of holineſs, and allow ſome time conſtantly each day for this holy exerciſe of thy ſerious thoughts and contemplations. To meditate on God, his Word and Works; on the Soul, its being, immortality, duties, evils, and intereſts; on the the World, its vanity and emptineſs; on Sin, its nature and iſſues; on Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, its excellency and bleſſed advantages; on Death, Judgment and Eternity, with whatever might yield inſtruction and profit: Urge thy conſcience with the command of God, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Saints, the great neceſſity, and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:132285:156"/> many advantages of this duty; conſider the great and uſual averſneſs of thy heart to it, which doth manifeſtly beſpeak its ſpirituality and excellency; for the more nature is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a duty, the more of God is uſually in ſuch a duty: think alſo of thy manifold loſſes and diſadvantages thou haſt ſuſtained by thy neglect of it, and pray hard for the ſpirit to help thy ſoul in the due performance of it; which hints I can only leave with thee without further enlargement, leſt it ſhould ſwell this Volume beyond its deſigned bounds.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, If you would drive on this heavenly Trade, you muſt be keeping up heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes every day, and upon every occaſion: much of earthly Trades is carried on by earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcourſes, this way they drive bargains, and barter away goods: a great many words oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times go to chaffering, buying and ſelling: and ſo is it in this heavenly Trade; Religion is much advanc'd by a ſpiritual improvement of mens talk and converſes; this way did the ſearers of God keep alive Religion in evil times, when other helps were wanting, <hi>Mal. 3. 16. Prov.</hi> 10. 21. By this ſouls come to be fed and nouriſhed in their holy Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6. A great deal of good or hurt comes by mens diſcourſes. O the miſchief Chriſtians do to each other by their vain, carnal and earthly communications when they come together! <hi>Evil communications corrupt good manners,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 33. <hi>Whoſe word doth eat as doth a canker, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 17. This way does Satan put off much of his wares, even by Wiſdom's Merchants,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:132285:156"/> making them to weaken, cool, deaden, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt one anothers ſpirits, ſtir up, feed and ſtrengthen each others corruptions, become temptations and provocations to one another to ſin, by their ſinful corruptions: 'Tis ſad to think how the work of God ceaſes, and the work of Satan proſpers this way: Perſons come warm ſometimes from a Sermon, and are ſoon cool'd by impertinent and vain diſcourſes; come from ſecret duty, when their hearts are quickned, and raiſed, and preſently deadned again by ſpirit-quenching diſcourſes. O how many labours of the Saints and Servants of Chriſt, and how many ſtrivings of the Spirit are overturned, and come to nothing by vain and rotten diſcourſes! no wonder the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity; it defileth the whole body, and ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature, and is ſet on fire of hell, Jam.</hi> 3. 6. Through the organ of an unſanctified tongue doth Satan ſhoot his fire-balls of temptation into the hearts of hearers: are you afraid of that fire which burns down your houſes? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of that fire that burns down ſouls to hell. 'Tis no ſmall part of a Chriſtian's wiſdom to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon, and to order (as his converſation ſo) his converſes to edification: When the Apoſtle preſſes the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 17. the next thing he adviſes to is holy conference, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. by mens language are they known of what Countrey they are; ſo are perſons diſcover'd, whether Citizens of Heaven, or the World, by their ordinary and deſir'd language. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> he
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:132285:157"/> went not ſo willingly to a feaſt, as to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to reduce any that erred. <hi>He that is of the Earth, is earthly, and ſpeaketh of the earth; he that cometh from Heaven is above all; and what he hath ſeen and heard, that he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, Joh.</hi> 3. 31. He will be ſpeaking of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, which he learnt of God: <hi>A good man out of the abundance of his heart bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out good things; for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh:</hi> The tongue is but the index and bucket of the heart, that tells men what things are within, and draws out of thoſe deeps to others; men uſe to find out what metals are hid in the earth by the colour of the ſand which the waters waſh away from the mountains: if the ſtreams be low, the ſpring is weak; an empty heart yields empty diſcourſes; <hi>By your words you ſhall be juſtified, or condemned: The tongue of the juſt is as choice ſilver, Prov.</hi> 10. 20. in that it is enriching to thoſe that are near it. <hi>The tongue of the wiſe is health, Prov.</hi> 12. 18. It ſendeth out ſound and wholſome words to the ſtrengthning of hearers: 'tis ſaid of the Spouſe, <hi>that her lips did drop as the honey-comb, honey and milk are under her tongue,</hi> Cant. 4. 11. <hi>And the roof of her mouth like the beſt Wine that goeth down ſweetly, cauſing the lips of thoſe that are aſleep to ſpeak, Cant.</hi> 7. 9. This doubtleſs is one reaſon of the little thrivings of Chriſtians in communion this day, 'tis from their barren and carnal communications; this ſtarves Religion both in thy own ſoul, and in thoſe thou converſeſt with; 'tis not maintained by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious converſes, and ſoul-edifying diſcourſes.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:132285:157"/> Chriſtians, lay this to heart; how can you bear the charge of all that decay in godlineſs this day upon your non-improvement of this part of your heavenly Trade?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Then do you carry on the heavenly Trade, when you improve every thing to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly advantages, getting good from every thing you meet with, do, or enjoy. 'Tis ſo in earthly Trades, all men ſeek their gain from their quarters, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 11. endeavour to turn every thing to ſome profit: And ſo ſhould hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Traders be getting ſome ſpiritual good from every thing that comes under their hand, and in their way, if ever they intend to thrive: this comports with the great deſign of God in all his adminiſtrations to his people, which is to do them good. <hi>Who fed thee in the Wilderneſs with</hi> Manna, <hi>which thy Fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at the latter end, Deut.</hi> 8. 16. To this end are his providences directed: <hi>The hand of our God is upon all them for good that ſeek him, Ezra</hi> 8. 22. And this leads to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promiſes towards Believers: <hi>I will ſet mine eyes upon them for good, Jer.</hi> 24. 6. I will not turn away from them to do them good, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. All their occurrences are brought under a promiſe of working for good. <hi>All things,</hi> the beſt and worſt things of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>ſhall work for good to them that love God, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. And why is this? but that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſouls ſhould be expecting good from every thing, every affliction, as well as mercy, that doth befall them; and be comporting in all
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:132285:158"/> their capacities with this deſign of God, by an improvement of all, to this great end of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage: <hi>What more good, O Lord?</hi> was the uſual ſaying of a godly man, when the Lord brought any new affliction upon him, with which he was much exerciſed, and from which he ever got ſome ſpiritual advantage.</p>
                     <p>For this end are gracious ſouls made capable to uſe their mercies, to bear and improve their afflictions to ſome ſpiritual good; they have a principle of grace planted in their hearts, and of divine light into their minds; and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived rules and inſtructions of purpoſe, that they might be able to reach this end: They are made men of wiſdom for this end, that they might hear God in affliction, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 9. and ſee God in mercies; and are skill'd in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Chymiſtry, that they might extract the ſpirit of providences, and good of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, duty and mercy. 'Twas ſaid of pious Mr. <hi>Dod, that he uſed to turn Earth into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a wiſe and ſpiritual improvement of all earthly affairs.</hi> A bleſſed metamorphoſis! and an argument of excellent skill and high attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this heavenly Trade, to turn Copper and Braſs into Gold, and to convert every thing, the worſt things to ſome good.

                     <p>Firſt, Priviledges are one thing which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſhould be getting good from, to theſe great and noble ends of ſpiritual good. Every heavenly Trader hath ſome priviledges which may afford ſoul-profit.</p>

                     <p>All which may contribute ſome profit to the improvers of them; Parts, Youth, Health, Strength, are part of Nature's treaſure, and to be husbanded to the uſe and ſervice of the ſoul: Theſe are ſome of thoſe talents the great Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder gives to his Family, (though in different meaſures) for improvement, and ſingular mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies they are, if well uſed to the Donor's ends and directions. A humble uſe of Parts to the good of others, and ſetting of wit, memory, reaſon, with the choiceſt intellectuals, and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt endowments of the rational mind, on the ſervice of the ſoul, 3 <hi>Epiſt. Joh.</hi> 2. making them
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:132285:159"/> hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the ſanctuary of the Lord: A ſhaving and paring off of the excrements and froth of wit, that they may become <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and devoted to the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſpiritual uſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 12. keeping them under the government of the ſpirit, is a good improvement of them in this heavenly Trade.</p>
                     <p>You that have Parts and habilliments of Mind, do not proſtitute them to the pleaſure of the fleſh, and the ſervice of ſin, but reſign them to the uſe of the ſpirit; towards your enrichings with true wiſdom, and encreaſes in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God, which brings ſalvation. When ſprightly Parts and ſparkling Wit are inlaid with grace, then are they as <hi>Apples of Gold in pictures of Silver, Prov.</hi> 25. 11. O how amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are theſe endowments of nature, when ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with grade, when <hi>perfum'd with Myrrh and Frankincenſe, and beſprinkled with the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Merchant, Cant.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
                     <p>Youthful time is another priviledg for ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage; 'tis the morning of the ſoul's day, the beſt and moſt uſeful part of time, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to God and divine uſes: what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage have ſuch for warmth of affection, and diſpatches of duty? whereas decrepit age, like an emerited Souldier, hath worn out its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable capacities; and as the ſetting-Sun, is attended with evening cold, and ſhadows, and the cloſe of working uſeful time. O how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable is old age for tranſacting the work of the new-birth, when Conſcience is ſunk down into the deeps of guilt! when the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:132285:159"/> are clogg'd with the dirty things of this world, and preengaged to other Lovers; and when the marrow of natures ſtrength has been eaten out by the waſting ſervice of ſin. So great and amazing a work is the ſalvation of a ſinner, that it deſerves a ſubject of the choiceſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities to be compleated in, and tranſacted by: And then is youth profitably ſpent, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to God, and taken up in the great matters of ſalvation. You that are yet in your youth and morning-time, let God have the ſpring of your time, the firſt-born of your ſtrength, and firſt ripe fruits of your capacities; let not youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleaſures have the flower of your time and abilities, leaving the bran for God and your ſouls.</p>
                     <p>You that have ſtrength of body, and a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful temper, put it to the beſt uſe for your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly intereſt. Are you ſtrong to labour? work out your ſalvation; labour for the bread that endureth; you that have legs, uſe them while you have them, to carry you up and down after God. If you muſt eat bread in the ſweat of your brows, let it be the bread of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe. If you muſt riſe up early, ſit up late, break your reſt, exhauſt your ſtrength, let it not be all for the world, let Chriſt have ſome of your ſtrength, before all be gone; yea, if you have any, let Chriſt have all.</p>
                     <p>As there are natural priviledges, ſo are there providential priviledges alſo, which are the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities that providence diſpenſeth to ſome, of doing and receiving good beyond others, as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, peace, plenty, with other outward mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:132285:160"/> all which are to be husbanded to the beſt advantage of your ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Have you Peace with men? improve it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtaining and ſecuring your Peace with God: Your firmeſt leagues with men will hold but a little while, if your covenant with God be broken; what can favour with men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit you, if you have frowns from God? If men ſheath up their ſwords, and God's be drawn, thy caſe is dangerous, and full of trouble. Make this uſe alſo of thy preſent Peace, to prepare for future trouble, and to be the better arm'd when trials come; ſpend not all thy ſtore upon thy preſent Peace and Comfort, but ſave ſome fragments for times of need. God gives thee a breathing-time, that thou mayeſt hold out the better in thy race; and ſpares thee a little reſt, that thou mayeſt be the fitter for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching trouble.</p>
                     <p>Have you Liberty? take heed of yokes of bondage, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. and ſoul-ſtraitnings. If God ſet you at large, do not impriſon your ſelves to the world and carnal luſts: Is thy body out of priſon? labour to get out thy ſoul alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 7. Are thy feet enlarged? get thy heart enlarged alſo, and run the waies of his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 132. Make the moſt of your Lilberty in doing ſervice to God, in attending on his appointments, and in taking all opportunities of doing ſalvation-work, and enjoying ſalvation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helps: Be like your Lord, going up and down doing good, while you have opportunity, <hi>Joh. 12. v.</hi> 35. If you have ſpare time, or can redeem it by double diligence from your earthly buſineſs,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:132285:160"/> lay it out for God and his people in religious duties, Chriſtian viſits, holy conferences: The time may come you may wiſh for ſuch a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and long to ſee one of theſe daies of the Son of man.</p>
                     <p>Have you yet a liberal portion of the good things of this life? is your garner full, your table ſpread, your cup overflowing? lay in the ſenſe of theſe mercies now, as winter-proviſion to warm your hearts then, when you may not have them to warm and refreſh your bodies, and lay them out to refreſh thoſe that want them, that they may bleſs God for you, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in you, and procure mercy for you in the day of need: Make not thy ſelf a ſlave to thy abundance, but make thy plenteous comforts ſerviceable unto thee.</p>
                     <p>There are Spiritual Priviledges too, the lot of ſome, and calls for great improvements. There are Perſonal Priviledges, the State and Spirit of Adoption, juſtification of perſons, purchaſed right to pardon and peace with God, freedom from condemnation, aſſurance of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in grace unto glory, with many gifts of grace and ſpiritual favours which thouſands enjoy not. And there are Publick Priviledges of acceſs to God, communion of Saints, a place within the walls of God's Houſe, with variety of ſoul-proviſions, an intereſt in the promiſes of God, the prayers and graces of his people, things of infinite worth, and purchaſed at no lower rate than the blood of Chriſt: You that are intereſted in thoſe, come under great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to behold them with wonder, to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:132285:161"/> hold them with trembling, and to uſe them with diligence and faithfulneſs. You that are planted in the Courts of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 13, 14. be fat and flouriſhing; content not your ſelves with bare priviledges, with dogs to feed on dry bones, but get the marrow, juice, and fattening vertue of all your advantages. Do not with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> lye at the door of your rich Lord, the Dogs licking your ſores, when you may go in and be healed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Ordinances are another thing which Believers ſhould be getting ſpiritual good from: Theſe are the golden pipes through which the Lord pours in the Oyl of grace into his golden Candleſticks, and Goſpel-Churches, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 12. Showres of Manna to feed his people in the wilderneſs, and on this ſide their own Countrey, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 16. Theſe are the Churches breaſts to fill and nouriſh her children unto life eternal, <hi>Iſa. 66. 11. Gen.</hi> 2. 6. 10. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are the Miſt, the River of <hi>Eden,</hi> by which God waters his Garden; Scriptures are the Mines, Ordinances are the opening of them, to ſuch as dig for Wiſdom. A conſiderable part of this Heavenly Trade is driven about theſe commodities; ply them well, that you may get large incomes of ſpiritual bleſſings through them: Take heed of ſleeping at theſe breaſts, or playing with them, leſt the Lord put them up, or put you off; lie at the pool ſide, wait at the wells of ſalvation, and not onely come, but draw out waters of life thence for your needy ſouls: For which four things are needful.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Prepare before you hear, get the room emptied, ſwept and garniſhed: For thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of Chriſt you are called to, bring your pitchers empty and clean, that God may fill them: Come not to clean food with a ſoul ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, but get your hearts purged by ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and waſh'd from an evil conſcience, and renewed by the Spirit; for the new wine of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. They muſt be new born babes, that receive the ſincere milk of the Word, ſo as to grow thereby, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 17. If a dead Chriſt muſt be laid in a new tomb; <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 60. ſurely a living Jeſus will not come into an old heart, and rotten ſepulchre. Spend ſome time before you go to hear, in ſearching your hearts, and reviewing your waies, in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deep ſenſe of their vileneſs, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinfulneſs of your ſins, that the fallow field of your hearts may be plowed up, and you ſow not among thorns: Take heed you bring not a hard heart to hearing. When <hi>Thraſamund</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> read <hi>Fulgentius</hi>'s defence of the truth, he praiſed his wiſdom, wondered at his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, commended his humility; yet had his heart ſo hardened, that he could not ſubmit to the truth. To help you herein, ſet prayer on work to beg down the Spirit's of aſſiſtance; bring your hearts to Chriſt by prayer, that he would
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:132285:162" rendition="simple:additions"/> make them clean: If he ſay, <hi>I will, be thou clean,</hi> thy Leproſie ſhall be cleanſed. Prayer alſo helps you to ſuitable proviſion, and a bleſſing on it: Hearers prayers help Miniſters to preach, and themſelves to hear, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 1. Souls ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thrive better than when Miniſters and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers be much in prayer for the Word of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Spirit with the Word. <hi>To pray well, is to ſtudy well</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="bottom">

                        <hi>Prayer</hi> (ſaies one) <hi>is a meſſenger to fetch that holy ſeed out of the garner above: Prayer is the former and latter rain to make it grow beneath; pray continually if thou would'ſt grow continually.</hi> After Chriſt had fed the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, he went up into a Mountain apart to pray. <hi>Matth. 14. v. 23. Secret prayer</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Trap) fats the ſoul, as ſecret morſels feed the body; therefore it is ſaid to be the banquet of grace, where the ſoul may ſolace her ſelf with God, as</hi> Eſther <hi>did with</hi> Ahaſhuerus <hi>at the banquet of wine, and have whatſoever heart can wiſh, or need require.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Take heed how you hear, hear as for your lives, with holy attention, with fear and trembling. <hi>Miniſters</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Latimer) ſhould preach as if Hell were at their backs, and hearers ſhould hear as if life or death were in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word.</hi> Hear with holy affection; many were given up to believe a lye, becauſe they loved not the truth, nor received the word in the love thereof, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10. Hear believingly; the Word preached did not profit, being not mixed with faith in them that heard it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. 'Tis by faith the Goſpel becomes the power of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:132285:162"/> God to ſalvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. The Arm of God was not revealed on <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe his report was not believed by them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 1. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is given out through the hearing of faith: Never expect to profit by hearing, till you joyn faith with hearing.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Keep the Word you do hear; take heed of letting ſlip the things you have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1. Hold faſt the truth that no man take your Crown, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 11. Be not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearers, but doers of the Word, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 25. Forgetful hearers will never be doers: <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s diſobedience was the fruit of their forgetfulneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 10, 11. The reaſon of the Diſciples trouble at the ſepulchre of Chriſt, was ſaid to be their forgetfulneſs; they had forgotten what he had ſaid to them when he was in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee, Luke</hi> 24. 6. Bad memories have many times barren lives: Be much in after-prayer for the Comforter's help to keep the Word for you, and bring it to your remembrance: Prayer opens the heart to take in the Word; and prayer ſhuts the heart to keep in the Word: keep up meditation of the Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. 91. This chews the cud, and gets out the ſweetneſs and nutritive virtue of it unto the heart and life: This way the godly come to be as trees planted by the waters ſide, that bring forth much fruit in their ſeaſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Obedience of the Word helps to profiting. The worth of Divine Truths is never fully known until they are liv'd upon; nor its virtue felt till we cleave to it in our converſation. <hi>Prov. 4. 6. Forſake her not, and ſhe ſhall preſerve</hi>(problem)
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:132285:163"/> 
                        <hi>love her, and ſhe ſhall keep thee. Verſ. 12. When thou goeſt, thy ſteps ſhall not be ſtraitned, and when thou runneſt thou ſhalt not ſtumble.</hi> O the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the pleaſure, the ſtrength, the bleſſedneſs that they loſe who onely look on truth, but do not live it! Strangers to a holy life meddle not with the joy that is wrapt up in the Word and Waies of God, <hi>Prov. 3. 17. Her waies are waies of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi> The Word of God yields out but half its ſweetneſs, until it becomes the way and walks of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 11. In keeping them there is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>My witneſs is in Heaven,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Cooper,</hi> upon his death-bed, <hi>That the love of Jeſus, and his peoples ſouls, made preaching my pleaſure; and I had no ſuch joy as in doing God's work. They are bleſſed that do his Commandment;</hi> not onely in that <hi>they have right to the tree of life,</hi> but in that they eat the pleaſant fruits of it, and feed upon that hidden Manna unto which bare hearers are ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Get all the good you can from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences; from favourable Providences, and from frowning Providences: Theſe are the North and the South winds, which the Beloved cauſes to blow upon his garden, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16. that the ſpices might flow forth. Providences, whether proſperous or afflictive, are to ſaved ſouls but the fulfilling of Divine Purpoſes, and the accompliſhment of precious promiſe, which are deſigned for the good of Believers. Obſerve the Providences of God if you would get good from thence. <hi>Obſervable things</hi> (ſaith worthy Mr. <hi>Blair) do follow them that are given to obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
                        <pb n="293" facs="tcp:132285:163"/> Doth God bring thee under ſmiling Providences? get ſome good from them: In theſe the Lord writes legible characters of his Covenant-love to his people. O read the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, love, bounty and faithfulneſs of God in them, and be affected! Get thy heart to write back letters of love and thankfulneſs to God again; entertain giving Providences with thankſgiving hearts, and the ſacrifice of praiſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 31. Let the Lord communicate with you concerning receiving as well as giving, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 15. If left-hand mercies flow in upon you, take heed leſt thoſe floods break their bounds, and carry away the banks of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and circumſpection. Chriſtians, 'tis a ſafe rule to fear your mercies as well as affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: There is uſually leſs fear, and therefore more danger of profeſſing friends, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemies. 'Twas the prayer of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>zabeth, To be delivered from her friends, as for her enemies ſhe would take care of them.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you have now a ſpring-tide of outward mercies, prepare for low-waters: The comforts of this world are not ſtanding pools, but running ſtreams, and rolling Seas, that ebb and flow; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not too much from them; entertain your comming mercies as ſtrangers, who have their time to go as well as come: <hi>The Lord gives, and the Lord takes, Job</hi> 1. 21.</p>
                     <p>Get good alſo from taking as well as giving Providences; be bleſſing God for them: There is more ſelf-denial and pure love to God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in ſuch acknowledgments, than in praiſes for beſtowing mercy, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 2. Beſides, divine
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:132285:164"/> grace runs as well through the empty chanels, as broad ſtreams of outward comforts: 'Tis the ſame hand of the Father that uncloaths, which dreſſes his children; the Fork as well as the Rake belongs to the Covenant of Grace and Peace; neither is love or hatred known by theſe things, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 1. Some have never found more than when they have loſt all: The Lord oft-times makes mens loſſes their gains, and their gain of earthly things their loſſes: <hi>Saul</hi> loſt his Aſſes, and found a Kingdom: <hi>Shimei</hi> found his ſervants, and loſt his life: Place not then your happineſs, no nor your comforts in theſe things: How many prick their fingers to get a few fading Roſes, which as ſoon wither as they are pluck'd: Think well of God under ſcattering Providences, and believe he loves you as much when he removes your mercies, as when he gives them: Look to God in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; ſee whence thoſe winds come that blow down your houſes, and ſcatter your comforts; enquire wherefore God contends with you, <hi>Job</hi> 10. 2. Doth not that worm which devours your gourd, breed in your ſecurity, pride, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs, and abuſe of them, while you had them? ſearch out the cauſe of God's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; juſtifie God in it, and bear his indignation humbly; come down at his feet, kiſs his rod, and hear the voice of it: This is to get good from the worſt of Providences.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Get good from the world, and things thereof; by ſeeing its wiles and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, its vanity and emptineſs, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 19. The world is a fading thing, the faſhion of it
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:132285:164"/> paſſeth away and it is gone. Trades-men care not for over-much of thoſe goods that are ſoon out of faſhion, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 2. O care not for the world, the faſhion whereof ſoon paſſeth away! 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31. The world is a dirty thing, 'tis hard to touch it, and not be defiled. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, be not like Swine, who love to run into the dirt; and if you would keep your ſelves unſpotted, take heed of the world. The world is a heavy ponderous thing; by faith make it portable, and more eaſie to be born, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. that it may not clog your feet, and ſtop your race towards glory: Faith will ſoon leſſen your burden, and mend your pace; it will turn braſs, yea clay into gold, and make it light in carriage. The world is a ſtrange Countrey to the Citizens of Heaven, get good from it, by living as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in the world, by making you long the more for your own home, by converting it to the ſervice of your ſouls, and intereſt in glory. <hi>The Scorpions in</hi> Caria, <hi>when they ſting, kill home-bred people, not ſtrangers.</hi> Apollon. Be a ſtranger to the world, and it will not hurt thee. The world is a ſubtle Strumpet, ſhun her embraces, lye not in her boſom, ſtop your ears againſt her charms, and ſhut your eyes from her allurements. The world is an enemy, beware of it; when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, believe it not; when it kiſſes you, take heed of the ſword in its hand, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 9, 10. when it cries peace, peace, then fear ſwift de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; ſet thy feet on its fair neck to keep it down; get it nailed to the Croſs of Chriſt, and pierced to death with the ſword and ſpear of the Spirit.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:132285:165"/> God puts you into, whether high or low, rich or poor: If you are above others in place, be above them in grace; if you enjoy more than others, labour to do more than others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 47. The higher you are in the world, be ſo much the lower in your own eyes: The talleſt Cedars bow moſt: Ships of the greateſt burden draw moſt water, and go deepeſt: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Angels rejoyce to be miniſtring ſpirits: Yea the Son of God delighted in being the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of men: <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a Prince, and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God, and yet counted himſelf beneath the leaſt of all God's mercies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. <hi>By how much the greater I am</hi> (ſaith <hi>Maximinus) ſo much the more I labour; and the more I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the greater I am.

Humble your ſelves when God exalts you; and when you humble your ſelves, God will exalt you.</p>
                     <p>Have you much of the world? take heed of puffings up; the more you have, the more you owe; the more you have of Earth, the leſs you may have of Heaven: The poor in the world may be rich in faith; and the rich in the world may be oft-times poor in faith: If God give you much here, be fearful leſt he give you your All here. When one offered <hi>Luther</hi> much gold, he proteſted God ſhould not put him off with theſe things. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, he could never read theſe words, <hi>Son, remember thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things,</hi> without horrour and aſtoniſhment, leſt having ſuch dignities he ſhould be excluded his portion
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:132285:165"/> in Heaven. Have you little in the world? you have the leſs to reckon for; you have the leſſer temptations, the fewer bryars and thorns to go through. Are you mean in reputation? you are ſo much the ſafer, and the more beneath envy. <hi>'Tis more to you</hi> (ſaid Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> to the Lord-Keeper) <hi>to win Heaven, being ſhips of great burden, and in the main Sea, than for little veſſels that are not ſo much in the mercy and reverence of the ſtorm.</hi> Are you low in the world? the more reaſon you have to lie low in your own ſpirits; a Prince's heart, and a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar's purſe do not well agree. Are you in want? make more uſe of Chriſt's fulneſs: 'Tis bleſſed miſery that brings ſouls to Chriſt for mercy: Had it not been for affliction, Chriſt would have had but little company whiles in the world: The whole need not the Phyſician; the ſick, the blind, the deaf, dumb, and poſſeſſed of Devils might bleſs God for their maladies, which were the occaſions of bringing them to the Phyſician of their ſouls as well as bodies: 'Twas well for the poor <hi>Canaanite</hi> that her daughter was ill, for by that means ſhe was put upon ſeeking crumbs, and while ſhe asked for them, got the childrens bread to boot, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 27, 28.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Get good from your Callings and Employments in the world, by preſerving a ſenſe of the ſnares and dangers that lie in the management of them. If men would take a ſtrict ſurvey of their Calling-carriages, and be true to their obſervations, they muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:132285:166"/> there are many evils they are guilty of in the management of them every day; either idleneſs, or exceſs of labours, deceitfulneſs, earthlineſs, lying, cheating, ſelfiſhneſs, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, carnal-mindedneſs, vain diſcourſes, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of words, murmuring, unthankfulneſs, with many other ſins of omiſſion and commiſſion, which they are expoſed to in the purſuit of their Employments: Now when the experience and ſenſe of this do keep them more humble and watchful againſt the occaſions and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of ſuch evils; when this helps to break and melt the heart before the Lord in prayer, fly to Chriſt in the ſenſe of their weakneſſes and inability to hold up under their temptations for all their help and grace to ſtand, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 15, 16. And when they labour to keep a tender ſpirit in all their dealings, and a holy jealouſie of their hearts in every thing they do; exerciſing ſelf-denyal, and mortifiedneſs to the world, and things below, then they get profit from their Callings, <hi>Prov. 41. 3. Pſal.</hi> 141. 3.</p>
                     <p>When they make their particular Callings to comport with, and ſubſerve their general; when mens buſineſſes in the world do not unfit them for, but are helpful in their religious duties, to keep their hearts in a meetneſs for ſpiritual ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, even while they are in their earthly Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, maintaining a walk with God in them, then they get good from their earthly Callings, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 18. Titus</hi> 3. 1. Sometimes God bleſſeth your Callings, and makes your basket and ſtore to encreaſe; then to be enlarg'd in thankfulneſs, and preſerve the memory of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:132285:166"/> God's goodneſs, is not onely your duty, but will ſweeten the enjoyment of your mercies: <hi>With my ſtaff I paſſed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands, Gen.</hi> 32. 10. To love him more, and ſerve him better, with more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and gladneſs of heart; this is profiting by your Callings.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes God blaſts your labours, and croſſeth your hopes, makes a breach upon your Trade, follows you with loſſes one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: In this caſe to look to the hand of God, to ſearch out God's end in all, to get good by it, to be the more weaned from the world, and to ceaſe from earthly ſtays, is a profitable uſe of your Callings.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Be getting ſome good from your company you reſide amongſt, meet or converſe with: The Lord offers, and ſouls may get much good this way: O the mercies that God deals out through mens company! 'Twas well for <hi>Rahab</hi> that ever the ſpies came to her houſe, for by that means ſhe obtained the ſalvation of her ſelf and family. What a mercy 'twas to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> when ſhe came to the Well, that ſhe found Chriſt there, who inſtead of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her pitcher with periſhing water, by this means got her heart filled with the waters of life, <hi>John</hi> 4. 15? What good did the Diſciples get by company in the way to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> who by that means had their cold hearts warmed, their weak faith ſtrengthened, <hi>Luke</hi> 25. 15. to the 32. Others have had company fatal to them: Had it not been for <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s houſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> might have eſcaped temptation to uncleanneſs,

                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 7. And had it not been for <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s houſe, he had not learn'd to ſwear by the life of <hi>Pharaoh, Gen.</hi> 42. 15. As long as <hi>Peter</hi> kept with the Diſciples, he was faithful and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; but when once he fell into evil company, and got into the High Prieſt's Hall, he preſently fell into that fearful ſin of denying his Lord and Maſter, <hi>Luke 22. 55. When they ſate down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Peter ſate down amongſt them.</hi> Chriſtians, beware what company you come into, for the peace and welfare (if not the life) of your ſouls, is much concerned in it: <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but rather reprove them, Epheſ. 5. 11. Prov. 1. 15. chap.</hi> 4. 14, 15. Chuſe not wicked company for advantage ſake, as <hi>Lot</hi> did with the loſs of his goods, and hazard of his life, and a dreadfull fall to boot, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 15. 36. Advantage was his end why he choſe the Plains of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but loſs was the iſſue of his choice: So <hi>Balaam</hi> for <hi>Balacks</hi> goods, run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into thoſe temptations that coſt him his life, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 8. Go not into wicked company ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept duty call you; if you have God's warrant, you have his protection; and if by providence, or in the way of obedience, you meet with evil men, be good with them; [<hi>The Sun</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes) viſits kennels, and is not defiled.</hi>] either by taking an occaſion to do them good, as the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitiſh</hi> Maid did to her Maſter <hi>Naaman,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting him to the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> for cure, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 2, 3. Or by putting a ſtop to their ſin, as <hi>David</hi> did. <hi>Pſal. 75. 4, 5. I ſaid unto the fools, deal not fooliſhly, and to the wicked, lift not up your horn.</hi> And as <hi>Judah</hi> ſought to divert his

Or by reproving their ſin, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did the ſin of the Nobles, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5. 7. Or by inſtructing them if ignorant, as <hi>Paul</hi> did the <hi>Athenians, Acts</hi> 17. 22, 23. But if they be ſuch like Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> that the thorns can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken by hand, let them be thruſt away, and get your ſelves fenced that they hurt you not: Take heed of the leaſt compliance with them in their ſin. 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 22. Be not partakers of other mens ſins;</hi> your own are heavy enough; ſilence in not reproving, with any ſigns of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving others ſins, make them your own.</p>
                     <p>If you enjoy good company, take heed you miſs not of good, or meet with evil from them: good men have their evils; great men are not alwaies wiſe, <hi>Job.</hi> 32. 9. And 'tis eaſier to follow them down, than up the hill, and to imitate their vices, than their virtues; diſeaſes are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable than health; men may impart their ſickneſs, but cannot their ſoundneſs. O what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage hath ſin for its propagation, when it falls from the hands of men reputed gracious! The errours of good men are not onely examples, but arguments unto others to ſin alſo: If <hi>Peter</hi> play the hypocrite, other <hi>Jews</hi> diſſemble like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 13. and no leſs a man than <hi>Barnabas</hi> is carried away with their diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Implicit imitation is as dangerous in practice, as implicit faith is in judgment: weigh their actions you intend to walk after; let no mans reputation be your warrant for imitation: Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons are File-leaders, which way they turn, the File turns with them: <hi>The leaders of my people cauſe them to err, Iſa.</hi> 9. 16.

                     <p>When you are in the company of thoſe that are above you in wiſdom and grace, be more ſwift to hear than to ſpeak: The emptieſt veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels make the greateſt ſound; and I have often obſerved in company, ſuch as have moſt need to hear and learn, being ſelf-conceitedly wiſe, will take up moſt of the diſcourſe; and inſtead of drawing waters from deeper wells to fill their empty veſſels, they will be pumping out that little they have: This ſurely doth not beſpeak the modeſty of ſuch, and leſs becomes their profit. <hi>Origen,</hi> when a child, uſed to queſtion with his Father about the ſenſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and afterwards became a great Scholar.

'Tis the obſerving attentive Chriſtian is uſually the moſt knowing, thriving Chriſtian; who, with the Bee, gathers in the Summer, and gets honey from every flower it meets with; and in the Winter ſpends it.

Chriſtians, if you would grow rich in Spirituals, make ſome ſpiritual improvement of all you ſee, hear, meet with in your journeys, dealings, converſes in the World: Thou walkeſt into thy Garden, get ſome inſtruction from the objects that thou caſteſt thy eyes upon: Every herb in thy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den preaches God to thee <note n="b" place="bottom">

                     <p>Ninthly, Get good from your falls and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages: Phyſicians do ſometimes make poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons medicinal, and ſo doth the Phyſician of of value make the diſeaſes of his people turn to their health.

                     <p>Firſt, That it cannot be that ſouls intereſted in Chriſt can live or allow themſelves in ſin; Becauſe</p>

That as Chriſt died for ſin once to die no more, but was raiſed by the glory of the Father, <hi>v.</hi> 4. ſo they being really dead with Chriſt, ſhould live no more in ſin, but be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually dead to it; for this is the very end of Chriſt's death, to deſtroy the old man, the body of ſin, the whole power and Being of ſin in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, to be accompliſhed in its time and

                     <p>Secondly, They that are in Chriſt are not only partakers of his death, and therein brought into a ſtate of death to ſin; but they are partakers of his reſurrection, and by it inſtated in a life of holineſs, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. that now they ſhould live to God, which cannot conſiſt with a life of ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They that are Chriſt's are brought under grace, under a Covenant of Grace, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Law as a Covenant of Works, and therefore cannot be any longer under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and ſervice of ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 14. Theſe two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants being in that reſpect contrary, they that are under the Law as a Covenant of Works, are in the fleſh, and bring forth fruit unto death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 5. and for that end are Believers ſet free from the Law, and brought under Grace, that they might ſerve God in newneſs of ſpirit, <hi>v.</hi> 6. and no longer ſerve ſin.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They are become the ſervants of righteouſneſs, ſet free from the ſervice of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18. Your time under ſin is out, and you have now no more to do with ſin; you are
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:132285:173"/> anothers ſervant, and therefore cannot return to the ſervice of ſin any more; for you are now ſervants to God, not for a time, but for ever; you have deliver'd over your ſelves, ſworn over your ſelves to be the ſervants of God for ever, and therefore cannot now ſerve ſin: That's his firſt anſwer: You cannot, if in Chriſt, ſerve ſin any longer, nor continue in ſin that grace may abound: for if you can conſent to live in ſin, you are not under grace.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, You ought not to do it, if you are rational; 'tis not your concernment to ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin is an evil thing.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Sin is the greateſt ſlavery in the world, <hi>v.</hi> 16. You are ſervants to ſin, and to Devils; ſins are the works of the Devil, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 8. which Chriſt came to deſtroy; ſin is evil in its ſtate; 'tis drudgery, and in its nature 'tis filthy, abominable and ſhameful.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is attended with ſad iſſues here; it brings forth bitter fruit, <hi>v.</hi> 21. It makes the ſoul aſhamed when awakened, to ſee what he hath done, and it fills the ſoul with grief, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and torment; it breaks your loins, makes you go halting to your grave; it makes you weary of your life, and fearful to die; it ſets your teeth on edge, and fills your bowels with wormwood and gravel. O the dreadful effects of ſin here! which makes it no way a ſouls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to ſin, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 11. Pſal. 51. 8. Pſal. 38. 4. Pſal. 119. 120. Pſal. 55. 4. Lam.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As the work is bad, and fruits are evil here, ſo the wages of ſin is death, <hi>v.</hi> 23. As ſoon as the work is done, they ſhall have their
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:132285:173"/> wages, which is alwaies paying, and never paid; they ſhall be alwaies dying, and never dead; <hi>whoſe worm never dieth, and whoſe fire is never quenched, Mark</hi> 9. 44. This will be the certain end of them that can chuſe ſin, and live in ſin, if God be holy, and his Word true. And can you then continue in ſin, that grace may abound? God forbid.</p>
                     <p>O Chriſtians! get good from your ſins; to be aſhamed of them, to grieve and mourn over them, to hate and loathe them, to pray and cry againſt them, to watch and ſtrive againſt them, to fly to Chriſt for pardon over them, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from them, to ſhun and avoid the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of them, to have no more to do with them, to ſeek and further the death and total ruine of them, to prize graces, and love Chriſt the more, to be more attentive to his inſtructions, and obedient to his commands, to bleſs God, and rejoyce in Chriſt; when God doth in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure keep you, or ſet you free from ſin, to long for Heaven and Glory, that you may never ſin more, to keep cloſe to Chriſt, and abide in his waies, that you might be the more ſecur'd from ſin, and fitted for glory, <hi>Ezra 9. 6. Zach. 12. 10. Ezek. 36. 31. Rom. 7. 24. Prov. 4. 14, 15. 1 Theſ. 5. 22. Epheſ. 5. 11. Epheſ. 2. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 7. 2 Cor. 5. 8. Acts</hi> 11. 23.

                  <p>The third branch of Exhortation is to Earthly Traders, who meet with breaches and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:132285:174"/> in the purſuits of their Earthly Trades. This is manifeſtly the caſe of <hi>England</hi> this day: The Lord blows on mens intereſts, makes breaches on their Trades, ſends in wants as an armed man; Trade fails, a blaſt is on mens labours, and the Nation becomes poorer every day: This ſhould be for a lamentation, but few lay it to heart; men murmure and complain; ſome are dejected and ſink in their ſpirits, others ſeeing God plucking their Idols away, hold them the faſter, become more cloſe and covetous; others ſink the deeper into the world, turn more earthly and exceſſive in their carkings and labours; others more griping and oppreſſive; but few in appearance look to God, and make a right uſe of this ſore ſtroak. Now towards a better improvement of this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, give me leave to propoſe to all ſuch theſe few Counſels.</p>
                  <div type="subpart">
                     <head>Counſel 1.</head>
                     <p>Firſt, By your diſappointments and loſſes in your Earthly Employments, be convinced of the tranſcendent excellency of this Heavenly Trade (which you have, it may be, in purſuit of thoſe too much ſlighted:) There are no ſuch iſſues of Wiſdom's Merchandiſe, if duly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Religion breeds no ſuch worms to devour its treaſures; <hi>Riches and honour are with me, yea durable Riches and Righteouſneſs: My fruit is better than gold, yea than fine gold, Prov.</hi> 8. 18, 19. There are no ſuch hazards in the waies of God, as here in my earthly buſineſs I am expoſed to: I labour hard, and can hardly live out; I ſow much,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:132285:174"/> and bring in little; I eat, but have not enough; and drink, but am not filled; I cloathe me, but am not warmed; I earn wages, but put it into a bag with holes; I look for much, and it comes to little, and when I have brought it home, the Lord blows upon it, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 6, 9. But 'tis not ſo in that Heavenly Trade I have neglected; there are no ſuch diſappointments; they that ſow to the Spirit, in due time do ſurely reap; they that labour for that bread, ſhall have it given to them. O how do Wiſdom's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants proſper when I decay! their faces ſhine, their basket is bleſt; whatever they have in the world, 'tis enough for them; they eat their bread with gladneſs, and ſingleneſs of heart, and are freed from thoſe anxious cares and fears I am almoſt conſum'd with: That's the beſt Trade, I now ſee it; when all fails, that holds; when others famiſh, that feeds; when others undo men, that enriches them: O bleſſed Calling! thou excelleſt them all. This is one good uſe of your earthly waſtes, to ſee the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Heavenly Treaſures.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, See God in theſe afflictions that lie upon your Earthly Trades and Intereſts: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction cometh not forth of the duſt, <hi>Job</hi> 5. 6. nor promotion from the Eaſt, or from the Weſt, but God is the Judge, he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 6, 7, 'Twas not the wind, the fire, the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> or <hi>Sabeans</hi> that undid <hi>Job,</hi> but it was God that took away, it was by his permiſſion all thoſe loſſes came,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:132285:175"/> 
                        <hi>Job</hi> 1. 21. This help'd <hi>Job</hi> to a due deportment under his troubles, that he ſaw God in it: <hi>He doth not fall out with man, or complain of the Devil; he is not angry with chance or fortune, with ſtars or conſtellations, but looks to God in all. Is there any evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it? Amos 3. 6. I form the light, and create darkneſs; I make peace, and create evil, Iſa. 41. 7. Iſrael</hi> decayed in their eſtates, and God ſaies, 'twas he that blowed upon them: Men uſually lay it on the times; cry out of one, and other, but few look to God, and that's one reaſon men make no better uſe of this Rod, becauſe they do not ſee it in the hand of a holy God: You will never lay your hand on your mouths, till you caſt your eyes on God in theſe troubles, nor take a right way for cure before you ſee the hand that ſmites you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 9.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, Search out the cauſe of them: You will not find the remedy, till you ſee the reaſon. <hi>Shew me wherefore thou contendeſt with me, Job 10. 2. Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſin? let us ſearch and try our waies, and turn again unto the Lord, Lam.</hi> 3. 39, 40. The Lord may well ſay to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainer, <hi>Friend, I do thee no wrong, Mat.</hi> 20. 13. And as <hi>David</hi> did to <hi>Eliab, What have I now done? is there not cauſe? 1 Sam.</hi> 17. 29. Hath God conſumed your eſtate, broken your Trade, brought you to a morſel of bread? and is there not cauſe? There are ſeveral ſins which do uſually prove waſting to mens earthly intereſts.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, A letting down of Religion, and decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this heavenly Trade, is uſually followed with waſtes on mens outward comforts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, as hath been already ſhewn: <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 8. When that flouriſheth, all things go well: when Religion goes down, nothing proſpers. 2 <hi>Chron. 24. 20. Why tranſgreſs ye the Commandments of the Lord, that ye cannot proſper? becauſe ye have forſaken the Lord, he hath alſo forſaken you.</hi> For this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down of Obedience did God threaten to make <hi>Iſrael</hi> waſte, and a reproach; to ſend evil arrows of Famine, and to break the ſtaff of Bread. <hi>Ezek. 5. 14, 16, 17. Becauſe ye multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied more than the Nations round about you, and have not walked in my ſtatutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the Nations round about you; you have increaſed in abomination more than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Nations round about you, and have not kept thoſe Laws, and done that Righteouſneſs which they have done:</hi> [Greenhill,] <hi>Therefore behold I, even I, am againſt thee:—Moreover, I will make thee waſte, &amp;c.</hi> Falling back in holineſs will make men fall back in the world too, bring a curſe on their abundance.

There is that ſcattereth, and yet encreaſeth; and there is that with-holdeth more than is meet, but it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to poverty.</hi> Many think that loſt which is laid out for God, and be-think nothing but what goes to pious uſes. O how ſparingly do moſt ſow, as if they thought their ſeed caſt away! and thence 'tis they reap ſo ſparingly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. Mens former charity, rather like ſhowers than ſtreams, are dried up; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are God's ſhowers with-held alſo: expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for God having been many, ſeems now bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome, through mens ſelf-love and unbelief. While <hi>Alexander</hi> had hope for more, he never wanted a heart or hand to part with the Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incenſe and Gold he had: certainly mens Faith fails when their Charity fades: Few in their ſcarcity dare, with the Widow of <hi>Zarephtah,</hi> give the firſt cake to the uſe and ſervice of God, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 13, 14. No wonder the barrel of Meal and cruiſe of Oil fails; 'tis Chriſtians wearineſs in well-doing, and defectiveneſs in
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:132285:177"/> ſcattering for God, hinders their reaping and gathering, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9. This was one of thoſe ſins that brought a curſe and devourer on <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el's</hi> encreaſe, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 9, 10, 11. and is ſtill as pregnant of blaſtings and mildews as ever it was.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Greedy deſires after the World are oftentimes followed with diſappointments: <hi>Ye looked for much,</hi> Hag. 1. 9. <hi>and it came to little, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Sept.</hi> To look with deſire and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. 'Tis mercy in God, when mens hearts run too faſt after the World, to lay ſome blocks in their way, to hedg it up with thorns, that they might not overtake their Lovers <note n="i" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Spes in oculis, luctus in manibus;</hi> Jerom.</note>. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 6. Thorns in mens way is ſafer than ſpears in their bowels, and that would have been the iſſue of ſuch Lovers when they meet. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs is the Hydropick diſtemper of old aged profeſſion: to cure which, the great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian hath providentially preſcribed abſtinence, and in his holy jealouſy hath made men to read their ſin in their puniſhment. The Lord ſees it dangerous for his people to have much of this World, becauſe it becomes a ſnare to their ſouls; <hi>They that will be rich fall into temptation and a ſnare, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 9. Earthly things are the very bane of Religion, they entangle mens feet, and keep them from attendance on God in his appointments. The invited gueſts had no leiſure to enjoy refreſhments for their ſouls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their interrupting intereſts of this World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 5. The things of Heaven ſeem light to ſuch, compar'd with their other
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:132285:177"/> things: <hi>They made light of Chriſt's invitation,</hi> and put men on pleading excuſes for neglect of God, and on juſtifying their omiſſions of holy duties: <hi>They began with one conſent to make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe:</hi> Chriſt and his people would have more of mens company, if the World had leſs of their hearts.</p>
                     <p>Theſe earthly things do not only hinder mens duties, but their thrivings alſo under privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: 'Tis the cares of this World, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of Riches, that choak the Word, and make men unfruitful, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 22. They make careleſs, ſleighty, forgetful hearers; they hinder convictions, quench the motions of the ſpirit, take away the taſtes of divine ſweetneſs, and make all the attempts of Grace fruitleſs: They take away the heart from God and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, and ſo nouriſh formality and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie in profeſſion and duties, cauſing men to draw near with their mouths to God, when their hearts are far from him, <hi>Ezek. 33. 31. Iſa.</hi> 29. 13. This made <hi>Judas, Ananias, Demas, Simon Magus</hi> ſuch hypocrites in Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they loved this preſent World, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 2, 5. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
                     <p>This weakens faith, blinds the mind, ſtarves the affections, rules the will, and ſo mans all the royal forts of the ſoul againſt Chriſt; by which the ſalvation of that ſoul becomes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding difficult.</p>
                     <p>And they make proviſion for the fleſh to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the luſts thereof, feeding the carnal mind, and yielding ſuch nouriſhment to ſin, as that it always reſiſts the Holy Ghoſt, wins the day, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:132285:178"/> damnation ſure to all that are not by a mighty hand redeemed from theſe ſpiritual enemies; ſo that it becomes in ſuch a caſe need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſtarve earthly deſires, by a remove of thoſe things that feed and maintain them; and men may look upon thoſe afflictive providences on their intereſts, as the procurements of their earthly affections: Haſtening to be rich, hath poverty at the heels, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 22.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Unfaithfulneſs in mens Callings puts them out of the way of bleſſing, and uſhers in waſtes on their intereſts, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. The Lord had a controverſy with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and till this was taken up, all their religious ſervices were to no purpoſe; ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and duties could not prevail, or ſtop his diſpleaſure, till their ſins were removed, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. 'Twas not to wait on God in publick duties was all that he called for, <hi>but to do juſtice, ſhew mercy, and to walk humbly with him,</hi> wherein they had been defective; and therefore had he brought a rod upon them, <hi>v.</hi> 9. he had made them ſick in ſmiting them, and would make them deſolate, <hi>v.</hi> 13. They ſhould eat, but not be ſatisfied; and there ſhould be a caſting down in the mid'ſt of them; they ſhould be blaſted in their labours and intereſts; they ſhould ſow, but not reap; tread the Olive, but not anoint themſelves with it; have ſweet Wine, but not drink it; and then comes to reckon with them, wherefore this was brought upon them; <hi>ver. 10, 11, 12. Are there yet the treaſures of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the houſe of the wicked? and the ſcant meaſures that is abominable? Should I count them
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:132285:178"/> pure with the wicked balance? and with the bags of deceitful weights? for the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the Inhabitants thereof have ſpoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouths.</hi> They were full of wickedneſs, and among the reſt, were falſe and deceitful; they did not walk humbly with God, nor juſtly with men, but were deceitful in their Callings, had falſe weights, ſcant meaſures, were injurious to others, and not juſt and faithful in their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſome oppreſſed, others defrauded; ſuch as were over others were cruel task-maſters, exacting their labours, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 8. 3. grinding the faces of the poor, eating them up as bread, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 4. by defrauding them of their due, keeping back the hire of the Labourers by fraud and injuſtice, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 4. which they do (ſaith one) who give them not a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hire, working upon their neceſſities, ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ſtrength and ſweetneſs of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, Dr. <hi>Manton.</hi> A ſin that cries in the ears of the Lord of Sabbaths, cries out aloud, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        </gap>, and their groans are entred into his ears, as a God of vengeance to requite it, and to give his poor a Sabbath, and reſt from their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: A ſin that God will ſurely and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſh; <hi>He will be a ſwift witneſs againſt them that oppreſs the Hireling in his wages, and turn aſide the stranger from his right, and fear not me, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Mal.</hi> 3. 5. Sins joyn'd with Adultery, Sorcery, and Swearing; provocations in God's ears, and actions that plainly ſhew no true fear of God in ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that dare oppreſs their poor Labourers,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:132285:179"/> changing their wages as <hi>Laban</hi> did <hi>Jacob</hi>'s, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 41. Theſe God will ſurely take in hand; he will be both Judge and Witneſs againſt them; he will not delay neither, but proceed ſpeedily to ſentence and execution againſt ſuch as oppreſs their poor labourers: Of all oppreſſion, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the poor is greateſt, and carries moſt cruelty in it, to tread on them that are down already, and abuſe them that have no helper; to take the bread out of their mouths which are ready to ſtarve, and to defraud them of their wages, which is their life, and God calls it down-right robbery, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 13. To build up their houſes, and raiſe up eſtates upon the ruines of the poor labourers, is to lay the foundation in blood, and hath a woe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt it from the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11, 12. This is one of thoſe ſins which bring a people down to the ground, and make them deſolate: <hi>Ye have eaten up the Vineyard, the ſpoil of the poor is in your houſes; what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. Her gates ſhall lament &amp; mourn, and ſhe being deſolate, ſhall ſit upon the ground, Iſa.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 26. This is a God-provoking, and an eſtate-waſting ſin, and one of the great, viſible, crying ſins of this day.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Another reaſon why God conſumes the intereſts of men, and makes a breach on their Trade, ſeems to be this; That by this means he might bring them down to his foot, and bring them back to himſelf: Proſperity in mens intereſts feeds their pride, and makes them too high for God's uſe and pleaſure; riches do

Men are apt to glory in their riches, and to give that reſpect to them which is due to God, and this he will not bear, but comes out in indignation againſt mens Idols, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 23. Abundance of earthly intereſts doth alſo unfit men for God's uſe and delight, rich in goods, and poor in grace; proſperity in the world cools mens hearts towards God, and lames their feet in his way: 'Tis the poor of the flock that waits on God, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 11. that preſs his Vineyard, and bear the heat and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the day, <hi>Jer.</hi> 52. 15.

                     <p>Fourthly, If God hath made breaches on your Trade, get the breach between God and your ſouls compoſed: <hi>Hoſ. 4. 1, 2. Hear the Word of the Lord ye children of Iſrael, for the Lord hath a controverſie with the inhabitants of the Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the Land; by ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and committing Adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood:</hi> There's a controverſy between God and a ſinning people (and ſuch are we:) Sinners contend with God, &amp; God by afflictions contends with them, and till this controverſie be taken up, there's no peace. <hi>And if ye will not for all this be reformed by me, by theſe things, but will walk contrary to me, then will I alſo walk contrary to you, and will puniſh you yet ſeven times for your ſins, Levit. 26. 23, 24.

Get waſht

Get trading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins removed, if you would have trading mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies enjoy'd: Take every man his Cenſer, and ſtand in the gap; pour out ſtrong cries for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning-mercy, that the Lord would ceaſe from his fierce wrath, and turn again, and heal our Land, and bleſs our ſubſtance, accept the work of our hand, and dwell in our Land.</p>

                     <head>Counſel 5.</head>
                     <p>Fifthly, Get advantage from decaies in your Earthly Trade, to further your Heavenly Trade; gather materials from your earthly ruines, for your heavenly building. Chriſtians, there's a great deal of good you may get from theſe evil things in the world, to quicken your purſuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the things of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By your earthly loſſes you may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the vanity and uncertainty of all things below God: Men are apt to take up too much pleaſure in their booths, till God ſends a devouring worm and conſumes them; and to ſit down under their ſhadows with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and therefore doth God make them like ſhadows to fly away; what expectations do men raiſe from their ſwelling-comforts, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their mountains are made ſo ſtrong, they ſhall not be moved, till the Lord by ſome le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling providence ſoon corrects their fond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion!
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:132285:182"/> and what dependencies do we uſually take up on thoſe uncertainties, leaning ſo hard on our reeds, till they break under us, and ſend ſplinters into the arm which ſtaies upon them? O the contentment, pleaſure, profit, men fancy to be in creatures, friends, relations, honours, eſtates, before by ſome killing ſtroak they ſee themſelves to be deceived! What mercy is it then to meet with diſappointments in theſe groundleſs hopes, that we may come to ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late, what poor, empty, periſhing things all the wares of this lower world are! This way <hi>David</hi> came to have his errour ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably corrected. And <hi>Solomon,</hi> by a ſerious review of paſt enjoyments, comes to ſee that all was vanity and vexation of ſpirit, <hi>Eccleſ. 2. 1. Surely every man walketh in a vain ſhew; they are diſquieted in vain; he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who ſhall gather them, Pſal.</hi> 39. 6.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Divine rebukes on mens earthly intereſts, help them to a diſcovery of thoſe ſins that procure them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 17. Afflictions are Chriſt's clay and ſpittle to open his peoples eyes, and to bring them to ſee thoſe evils that have brought thoſe deaths upon their comforts, and breed thoſe worms that have deſtroyed their ſubſtance. Times of correction, are times of inſtruction, <hi>Job</hi> 36. 8, 9. When <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Sons were cut ſhort of their proviſions, reduced to great diſtreſs, and plunged in ſore dangers, then they thought upon their ſin, and wrong done to their brother <hi>Joſeph, Gen. 42. 21. Then they ſaid one to another, verily we are guilty concerning our brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:132285:182"/> when he beſought us, and would not hear, therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us:</hi> Whence one hath this note, <hi>Affliction is a dark condition, yet it brings much light into the ſoul.</hi> Men come to read their miſcarriages beſt by the fire-light of affliction; <hi>then Manaſſeh knew that the Lord was God, 2 Chron.</hi> 33. 13. Now the ſoul comes to ſee his abuſe of theſe mercies he hath loſt, his inordinate love to them, and wandrings from God, and this helps to after-wiſdom, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter freedom from theſe entanglements for the time to come, which is no ſmall advantage to future godlineſs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By this loſs of earthly things, the ſoul comes to ſee a neceſſity of looking after, and enſuring better treaſures: <hi>Heb. 13. 14. Here have we no continuing City, but we ſeek one that is to come.</hi> Uncertainties on Earth ſhould put ſouls the more to look after Heaven. The Prodigal never thought of returning till all was gone, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 14. to <hi>verſe</hi> 18. The Steward never conſidered how to ſecure his future ſtate, till goods were waſted, and Stewardſhip in danger of removal, <hi>Luke 16. 1, 2, 3, 4. Think of ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhore</hi> (ſaid Mr. <hi>Rutherford) after a ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack. 'Tis a mercy in this ſtormy Sea to get a ſecond wind, for none of the Saints get a firſt.</hi> This is advantage indeed, when having nothing, you ſeek to enjoy all things; and when the world flies from you, to purſue Heaven the faſter. Could a Heathen ſay, <hi>I never gain'd mere than when I loſt all;</hi> becauſe his ſhipwrack became the occaſion of obtaining knowledge; and will not you Chriſtians by your earthly loſſes be
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:132285:183"/> provoked to make after heavenly intereſts?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Loſſes in the world have an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage through grace to looſen the heart from the world. Afflictions on mens eſtates are like wormwood on the breaſt, that tends to wean the hearts of God's children from them: Love of the world hath been the ſin of this Age; and the ſhipwrack of worldly things is the likelieſt way to cure it; this diſeaſe is beſt conquered by faſting. Abſence of Lovers is ſometimes the way to ſtarve affections; and poverty with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs is God's uſual method to chaſtiſe mens wanton affections to this world. Afflictions when ſanctified, are Sanctuary-fire to purge away the droſs of our affections, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
                     <p>5ly. Soul-enlargement is another fruit of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified ſtraits, and ſo a help to the heavenly trade. Chriſtians are never fit to make any ſpeed in the way to Heaven, until their hearts be enlarged, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 32. Enlargements in the world are oft-times bonds to the ſoul: He that hath moſt of the Earth, hath uſually leaſt liberty for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. When the Lord cuts ſhort the intereſt of his people, he doth but knock off golden fetters from their feet, that he may bring their ſoul out of priſon. Afflicting Providences are God's dieting his racers, that they may be more long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breath'd, and ſwift in their run towards glory. O how impriſon'd are redeemed ſouls in the many things of this world! they cannot have time to pray, read, hear, confer for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling-affairs of this life, till God by ſome deaths upon their employments ſets them at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Removes of worldly treaſures are but
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:132285:183"/> the taking off of a heavy cloak-bag from the ſhoulders of <hi>Sion</hi>'s Travellers, that they may the more comfortably travel to their journeys end. Good ſouls, whiles crouded with earthly buſineſſes, are like perſons in the midſt of a thicket, and thorny grove, when they would be going forward, one briar hangs in their skirts, and another thorn ſtops their way; ſo that when God takes off their intereſts, he doth but cut out a way for his children to paſs the more comfortably and ſwiftly through the brakes of this world, and lighten the veſſel that it might ſail faſter and ſafer to its deſigned port; and is not this advantage?</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Sweeter reliſhes of heavenly things are to Believers the bleſſed iſſues of the world's bitterneſs: Harſh Providences on earthly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts make heavenly things the more pleaſant. Men ſometimes engraff ſweet fruit on crab-tree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocks, and God gives honey to his children at the top of the rod, <hi>Pſal. 94. 19. [The thorn is one of the moſt curſed, and angry, and crabbed weeds, and yet out of it ſprings the Roſe, Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>] The ſweet-meats of this world do too often put Chriſtians pallats out of taſte; to cure which, doth the Lord diſh out his daintieſt meat with ſowre ſauce: Heavenly things never reliſh better, than when there is leſs ſweetneſs in the creature. What a value did <hi>David</hi> put upon ſpiritual things when ſtript of all! <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 1. Goſpel-comforts will not down with ſuch as are choak'd with the world's delicacies; but when once the Saints are emptied of the world by croſs providences, then is Chriſt precius: &amp; is not
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:132285:184"/> this a help to Heavenly Traders? O then! the more croſſes you meet with in the world, the more haſte do you make to your Crown. Doth the world fly from you? purſue Heaven the faſter. Doth gain fall? then advance godlineſs: And if your gettings from Earth be ſmall, let your layings out for Heaven be great. And thus much for the third Branch of Exhortation.</p>

                  <head>4th. Advice to ſuch as are fallen back in Religion.</head>
                  <p>Fourthly, A word to ſuch as have begun this Heavenly Trade, and are fallen back: This is the caſe of ſome, and may be of more in this hour of Temptation and Apoſtaſie: There are ſome have begun in the Spirit, and are now end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the fleſh; who have made a fair ſhew, ſeem'd to be ſomewhat, and like blazing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, drew the eyes of admirers on them for a time, and then fell down to the Earth. Some that have left the very form; others that have loſt the power and life of godlineſs: Many have laid down their Lamp; but more have ſpent their Oil, and are almoſt come to a ſnuff: Some have ſhut up ſhop, are quite gone, and have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their leave of Religion, reſolving to return no more, unleſs ſafety, credit and intereſt return with them: Others yet ſtay, keep open ſhop, but have little goods; decay daily, and are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the breaking hand; a waſte is on their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, they have loſt their firſt love, decay'd in ſpirituals; faith, hope, love, zeal, delight in God, and livelineſs for him are quite loſt; as hath been demonſtrated in the uſe of Lamentation.
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:132285:184"/> The deſign of this head is only to offer ſome advice towards the recovery of decayed broken Traders: In which, as hitherto, for better illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration I ſhall keep to the metaphor in the Text.</p>
                  <div type="subpart">
                     <head>Advice 1.</head>
                     <p>My firſt Advice to ſuch in order to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, is to be deeply affected with their evil caſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Conſider, 'tis no ſmall change for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that hath lived well, been in reputation with God and men, fared deliciouſly, been uſed to the dainties of God's houſe, and delicacies of his love; have taſted the heavenly gift, and the powers of the world to come; now to be brought to penury, and ſcarce meet with a ſweet morſel from day to day; to be put off with husks and dry bones, and the crumbs that fall from their Lord's Table; to ſtand at his door, or to wait without for ſome ſcraps, when the friends of Chriſt, and Wiſdom's thriving Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, have their marrow and fat things; this is a great change.</p>
                     <p>For ſuch as were wont to have a place amongſt them that ſtand by, to converſe with the Father of Spirits, to be let into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence chamber, and have the viſits of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, and ſpiritual fellowſhip of Saints: Now to be laid aſide, and ſcarcely look'd upon with a divine glance from day to day, no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with God, or fellowſhip with the Spirit, from one Lord's day to another, but to be only company for formaliſts and hypocrites, and ſuch as are without; this is a great change. O get
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:132285:185"/> thy heart deeply affected with it!</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Think alſo how unlovely, offenſive and diſpleaſing an object in the eyes of God, a withered, decayed Profeſſor is; <hi>his ſoul takes no pleaſure in him, Heb.</hi> 10. 38. He doth not care for the company of ſuch, they are a burden to him, he loves no more to ſee them, than men do dead corps in their houſes, and rotten trees in their garden; he bethinks the place they ſtand in as cumbring the ground, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 7. he counts them unworthy of the Kingdom of God, having put their hand to the Plough, and then look back, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 62. Nothing more troubles his ſoul, than a lukewarm temper, that was once burning in love, but now is neither hot nor cold; ſuch ride on the ſtomach of Chriſt, and make him down-right ſick, till he hath vomited them out into the dunghill from whence they came; and is not this matter of trouble to a ſenſible heart? <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Such have little deſirableneſs in the eyes of men alſo. Who cares to deal with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Merchants; or keep company with ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts, that have waſted their eſtates, and are come to nothing? no more do gracious ſouls care for converſe with backſliders. Decayed Profeſſors are like broken veſſels in whom there is no pleaſure; and as a withered hand, or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bone in the body, which hath loſt both its uſefulneſs and beauty. A broken Trader in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is valued by none; the men of the world cannot endure him, becauſe he hath been ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly godly; and Saints cannot love him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not really gracious: Such, like <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom</hi>
                        <pb n="335" facs="tcp:132285:185"/> (when hung by the hair) lye between Heaven and Earth, as unworthy of either; and as a perſon held in a ſtrait paſſage, cannot go forward nor backward; he cannot go far enough to keep pace with the prophane, nor go back to fill up his place with the pious; the Saints reject him, the wicked will not receive him: In ſuch a pitiful caſe is a withered decayed ſoul, he hath no comelineſs in him for which he ſhould be deſired.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They are the greateſt loſers of any who break in Religion; for they not onely loſe their own goods, but others alſo; their talents; graces, priviledges and experiences, are their Lord's goods, which they have waſted in riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous living; they loſe what they once had, what they ſeemed to have, or were fair for; and they loſe what they hope to have, <hi>Luke 16. 1. Mat. 25. 29. 2 Epiſt. Joh. v. 8. Gal.</hi> 3. 4. All their enjoyments, taſtes, comforts, frames, experiences, are loſt: All their profeſſion, faith, love, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, are ſhipwrackt: All their duties, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſufferings, come to nothing, if they are not recovered again to repentance. Here men eſtimate their loſſes to be great, from the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, variety or abundance of the things they loſe; all which are yet but temporal; but the Treaſures that Profeſſors are in chaſe of, and which they ſhall ſurely have, if they be ſincere and faithful to the death, are eternal; of all which, by their backſlidings (if uncur'd) they are depriv'd: O who can count the ſum, and value the worth of thoſe glorious things they fall ſhort of, who fall back, and go down in
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:132285:186"/> Chriſtianity, till they come to nothing!</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Their caſe is dangerous alſo, and their wound hardly healed; not one of many that fall back in Religion, if they go far, recover again. <hi>Joh. 6. 66. From that time many of his Diſciples went back, and walked no more with him.</hi> When <hi>Judas, Simon Magus, Hymeneus, Alexander, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> went off from Chriſt, they returned no more: <hi>John</hi> tells us of ſome that went out from them, and thereby declared that they were not of them. 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 19. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks not of ſuch as fall out of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, falling in the way, which gracious ſouls may do, both falling into ſome ſin for a time, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and fall back by ſome abatements of grace, as the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> yet be recovered; ſuch he intends not here; but thoſe that fall out of the way, both totally and finally, theſe recover no more.</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> If perſons that fall back in Religion after a high profeſſion, may never be recovered again; how may one know if he find decaies, and falling back in Religion, whether he be one of thoſe that ſhall never be bealed or recovered more? This is my caſe, I find great declenſions in my ſoul and converſation, and I fear I ſhall never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, but wax worſe and worſe, and periſh at laſt.</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Firſt, Are not thy declenſions thy choice, upon judgment and conſent, but againſt
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:132285:186"/> the ſtanding bent of thy heart? the renewed purpoſes of thy ſoul through Chriſt: Thy er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is not thy aim, thou doſt not deliberately contrive thy departure from God, but haſt a ſecret would-not againſt every backſliding; then thy backſlidings ſhall be healed again, <hi>Pſal. 119. v. 10. Rom.</hi> 7. 19, 25.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Are thy backſlidings and ſpiritual decaies thy ſoul-trouble, and reſtleſs burden, becauſe of thy diſtance from God as the God of grace, and Father of thy mercies; and becauſe of the injury thereby done to thy graces and inner man, and from an enmity in thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt ſin? Then there is hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning this, that thy backſlidings ſhall be healed, <hi>Rom. 7. 24. Pſal. 5. 1, 7. Luke 15. 21. Gal.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Are thy backſlidings after thy Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Calling, and thy ſincere choice of God to be thy peculiar and alone portion? Thou canſt appeal to the ſearcher of hearts, that thou haſt taken the Lord to be thy God and onely Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure here, and to all eternity to be thy laſt end and chiefeſt good; and haſt taken Chriſt to be the onely way, truth and life, thy Lord and righteouſneſs; and haſt made a full and actual ſurrender of thy ſelf and thy All to God in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, to be preſently, unreſervedly, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally his, and not thy own, to be led and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by him onely: If ſo, thy after-errours cannot make void this Covenant, but are under a promiſe of healing; <hi>ſuch cannot ſin unto death, becauſe the ſeed of God remaineth in them, 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 9. They are undertaken to be kept, that they
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:132285:187"/> ſhould not totally and finally depart from him, <hi>Jer. 31. 18. Iſa. 57. 18. Jer. 3. 14, 22. Hoſ. 14. 4. Jer.</hi> 32. 40.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Art thou reſtleſs in thy back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings, until the Lord doth heal thee? thou canſt give him no reſt till he eſtabliſh thy ſoul, and be as the dew to thy dry and barren heart: When God ſets a ſoul a crying, it's a ſign he will hear: <hi>Jer. 30. 15, 17. Iſa. 19. 22. A man</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Dod) can never be in a bad condition, except he hath a hard heart, and cannot pray? Will he delight himſelf in the Almighty? Will he alwaies call upon God? Job</hi> 27. 10. Backſliders in heart are heartleſs in prayer; as they decay, ſo do they reſtrain prayer, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 4. Ye have ſaid, it is in vain to ſerve God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14. As ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more delightful, ſo duty becomes more burdenſom, cold and formal; but a gracious ſoul that ſhall be healed is importunate with God, and will not let him alone, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 10, 11. or let him go until he bleſs him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 6. The worſe his condition is, the more fervent his cries are; the more his piety goes down, the more his prayers go up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. 2. Such a ſoul ſhall be healed, who would be healed; where he works to will, he will work to do.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Are thy vitals ſound under all thy decaies? then thy conſumption is not mortal: Is thy heart ſincere? thou canſt not hide or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve iniquity, but walkeſt before God in truth; thy deſires after grace are not feigned, <hi>Pſal. 17. v.</hi> 1. Thy love to God is not pretended, lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, but real; thy faith and love are not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gone, but maintained in the truth thereof,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:132285:187"/> though abated; thou canſt not let God go, but haſt a ſecret reſt on him, and reſolved recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bence on his grace and faithfulneſs. There is hope of that tree, though it ſeems to be cut down, that it will ſprout again, and the tender branches thereof will not ceaſe, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 7.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, If under all thy decaies thou findeſt a humble heart and contrite ſpirit; thy back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings make thee lie low before God, and to become more vile in thy own eyes every day; thy ſoul-poverty makes thee poor in ſpirit alſo, rating thy ſelf beneath the leaſt mercy, and judging thy ſelf unworthy of all that patience, priviledge and mercy ſhewn to thee; thou doſt not fret at afflicting providences, nor charge God fooliſhly, but beareſt his indignation, juſtifieſt his diſpleaſure, and wondereſt at his forbearance; then will revivings come again, and recovery after thy falling back, <hi>Dan. 9. 7, 23, 25. Mat. 5. 3. Iſa.</hi> 57. 15.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But on the other ſide, There are five dangerous ſymptoms of falling back that ſhall hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, If thy falling back be before thy falling in with Chriſt in truth; thy decaies before thy quickenings, then 'tis dangerous: If thy build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were on the ſand, and the towring heights of thy frames and profeſſion from which thou art fal'n, were onely ſtructures of thy own raiſing, in which the Sanctifying Spirit had no hand, then thy decaies are not likely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. Art thou a ſtranger to the new birth, and to any inward change upon thy ſoul? the principle of thy new profeſſion and actions is
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:132285:188"/> is ſtill an old heart: Thou never didſt take the Lord for thy God and onely Treaſure, nor hadſt to this day any heart-union with the Lord Jeſus; then thy fall is dangerous, <hi>Mat. 7. 26, 27. 1 John 5. 14. 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A falling off from the foundation is dangerous: When men depart from the Faith, turn to another Goſpel, and deny the Lord that bought them, fall from the Doctrine of Grace after enlightenings, to a Covenant of Works, laying the foundation of Salvation-hopes upon creature-performances and improvements, when they go from the Rule of Faith and Word of Truth, to natural light, and ſeducing ſpirits, which have not their evidence and approbation from the Scriptures. When perſons at once diſclaim dependency on the true foundation and diſpoſal by the Rule of Righteouſneſs 'tis much to be feared whether ſuch ſhall be reſtored, <hi>Gal. 1. 6. ch. 5. 4. Heb. 10. 26, 39. 2 Pet. 2. 15. Heb.</hi> 6. 4. 6.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When men make Merchandiſe of the Truth, and ſell their profeſſion for worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, having loved the reward of iniquity, and made a ſwap of their Religion for advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake: This is a mighty provocation to the Spirit, when men can ſell themſelves to work wickedneſs, and value the great things of God's Law, of his Truth and Salvation at ſo low a rate; to part with them for a meſs of pottage, and the dirty <hi>Cabals</hi> of this world: 'Tis ſeldom that ſuch find repentance, though they ſeek it with tears: See <hi>Judas, Simon Magus, Balaam, Demas, Spira:</hi> What remarks of furious indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:132285:188"/> God makes ſuch Apoſtates to be, who can part with their Religion for worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts! 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 10. 1 King. 21. 20. 2 Pet. 2. 3, 15. Acts</hi> 1. 18.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Backſliders in heart ſhall ſurely periſh, and be filled with their own ways, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 14. when falling back is upon choice, and with delight, like a deceitful Bow that is then at reſt when its ſtring is broken, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 57. When a man caſts off Religion as one doth his burden, and a beaſt his yoke, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 5. and is glad he is rid of his troubleſome work, as one that is got out of priſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32. This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a ſpirit of <hi>Belial,</hi> and a dangerous ſtate: Many have taken up a Lamp upon conſtraint, for faſhion, or intereſt, or for companies-ſake, as the fooliſh Virgins did, <hi>Prov. 14. 14. Pſal. 78. 57. Jer. 5. 5. Mat.</hi> 25. 1. But when opportunity hath offered it ſelf for a fair riddance, they have ſoon appear'd what they were by their chearful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the broad way of error and looſeneſs, falling in with other intereſts, and finding pleaſure in it: Now the world, reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pleaſure take away the heart, and they are well-pleaſed with other Lovers: this is a bad ſign of a deſperate ſtate, of mariſh-ground that ſhall never be healed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 11.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, When perſons are prejudic'd againſt the means of recovery, hate them that rebuke them in the gate, <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 10. ſhun the light, and cannot endure thoſe that would reclaim them from the error of their way, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. their hearts riſe againſt any attempts to reduce them, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 10. cannot bear them that are
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:132285:189"/> good, ſlight and hate the people of God they formerly loved, avoiding their company; jeer and reproach thoſe Miniſters, people and ways they once took pleaſure in: this ſhews a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtate, ſuch a perſons condition ſeems deſperate, and not far from the Chambers of death. O you that are fallen back in Religion! get your hearts affected with it: do you begin to decay? you know not where it will end: are you gone back? 'tis queſtionable whether ever you may return, and then what will your latter end be? your laſt ſtate will be worſe than your firſt; and if twice dead, you will be pluck'd up by the roots; if after ſhowers and dreſſings you decay, your end will be to be burned.</p>

                  <div type="subpart">
                     <head>Advice 2.</head>
                     <p>Secondly, If you would recover out of your waſting decays in this heavenly Trade, ſearch out the cauſes, and get them removed. There muſt needs be ſomething more than ordinary, when men who have a good Trade, which may be driven in the worſt of times, and will enſure advantage, if followed, do notwithſtanding fall back and decay: Such is Religion, it will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and enrich its followers, if they be not wanting to themſelves; there muſt needs be ſome great cauſes and miſcarriages then that doth caſt back the profeſſors of Chriſtianity, and bring a conſumption on their ſoul-proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: ſome of which may be theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When they enter upon this heavenly Trade, and have not a ſtock to ſet it up: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a great thing, and cannot be carried on
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:132285:189"/> without a ſtock of ſaving-grace to maintain it: Common grace is not a ſutable ſtock for this ſpiritual Trade; it may help men to tranſact the external part, and common works of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but cannot do the inward, ſecret, and choiceſt ſervices of godlineſs: <hi>A ſtranger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddles not with its joy, Prov.</hi> 14. 10. no, nor its work; <hi>They that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. 8. 8. <hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, Rom.</hi> 14. 17. it lies not in outward duties, <hi>but righteouſneſs, peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which no hypocrite can reach to. This ſpoils many, they take up a form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs without the power of it; and being ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the work within, they cannot carry on the works of grace without, which this ſtate calls for; and ſo fall back, and come to nothing. When perſons get ſome knowledg, parts, frames, and temporary graces; they preſently take up a Lamp of profeſſion, and get into the company of the wiſe, climb up to the enjoyment of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and then ſit down contented, and fall aſleep; and when they come to temptations, and ſpiritual duties, to the work of faith, love, patience, ſelf-denial, mortification, and the like; having not grace to ſupport them, and a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that ſuits ſuch work, they fall ſhort of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and into ſin, and ſo Trade, and fall away: Common grace is as a ſtanding-pool, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not a ſpring to feed it, dries up when ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies ceaſe, and ſcorchings come; whereas true grace is as a well of water, that ſprings up to life eternal.</p>
                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:132285:190"/>
                     <p>Secondly, Another thing that caſts back Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, is this; when they ſet upon an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and have not skill to manage it: Every Art hath its principles, rules and myſteries by which it is carried on: to deviate from theſe, is to mar the excellency, and miſs the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it: Irregular actions ſeldom thrive; ſo 'tis with the heavenly Trade, when perſons ſet upon it, and have not skill to order it to beſt advantage, no wonder if they proſper not, but fall back in godlineſs. <hi>Solomon</hi> directing to this heavenly Trade, adviſes to get wiſdom as the principal thing in order to it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 7. And when the Apoſtle would further the Saints in holy walking, as the neceſſary way to it, he begs wiſdom for them, <hi>Col. 1. 9, 10. That ye may be filled with the knowledg of his will in all wiſdom and ſpiritual underſtanding: that ye may walk worthy of the Lord to all, well-pleaſing, being fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in every good work.</hi> Two things made <hi>David</hi> thrive ſo much in his proper publick work; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of heart, and Underſtanding, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 72. He fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skilfulneſs of his hands: Some books read it in the plural number in the <hi>Greek; In skilfulneſſes,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, noting the great meaſure of wiſdom which men need who would proſper in their proper work, and order their adminiſtrations prudently, as might moſt further their ſpiritual welfare: The want of which wiſdom and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Chriſtians to order every thing they do in their general and particular Callings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes, conditions and occurrences in the World
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:132285:190"/> to the beſt advantage of their ſouls, is one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they thrive ſo little in their heavenly Trade: Wiſdom would teach men to prevent many ſnares and occaſions of evil, and inſtruct them how to get good from every thing they do, which would much advance their ſoul-profiting, for want of which they go back in ſpirituals, and decay apace.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This alſo caſts back Traders; when they are not diligent in the management of their Trade: <hi>A ſlothful ſoul ſuffers hunger,</hi> Prov. 19. 15. <hi>and by much ſloth the building decays; and through idleneſs of hand the houſe droppeth tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 10. They that will thrive in the World muſt be diligent, take all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to carry on their work: <hi>The diligent hand maketh rich, but by ſlothfulneſs men are brought to a morſel of bread.</hi> So 'tis in Religion, when men let down their work, and do not follow it to purpoſe, they ſoon decay, and become ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poor; this is the bane of many this day: Religion is not their buſineſs; men do but little on the Lord's day, and ſcarce a ſtroke of work is done all the week after; hear they will, and when that is done, their work is done too: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of what they hear, or put it to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice from one Lord's day to another: All the week their heads, hearts, hands, feet, time, ſtrength, diſcourſes, contrivances are wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about the World; and how can they chooſe but go down the hill, and waſte away in their ſoul-intereſts?</p>
                     <p>Religion is one continued work, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of no intermiſſion, but hath its work every
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:132285:191"/> day, and in every thing; break but one link of this golden chain of godlineſs, and it weakens the whole. O the ſlothfulneſs of Chriſtians at this day in their ſoul-buſineſſes! every day is fill'd up with neglects; neglect of prayer, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of reading, meditation, conference, heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watching, grace-cheriſhing-work, forget this duty; paſs by another, cold, ſleighty, formal in all; this ſpoils the proſperity of ſouls. The <hi>Galatians</hi> began well, but did not hold out, they were ſoon weary, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 7. Moſt mens journey to Heaven is full of ſtops, and that which makes it moſt miſerable, their lets are of themſelves: <hi>Who hath hindred you?</hi> Mens ſtays are within in their own hearts, they have no heart to do good, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 11. Love to Religion is almoſt gone, and this makes men weary in theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ways: while affections hold, ſouls are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver weary; but when the heart is gone, then every thing is a burden; ſuch will do no more than needs they muſt to quiet conſcience, and preſerve peace and credit; and this ſtarves god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Great and frequent loſſes in mens Trades tend to breaking; and ſo it is in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Chriſtians through their ſloth, formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and unwatchfulneſs ſuſtain many and great loſſes of ſpiritual mercies, and this brings them low. A Chriſtian the other day, it may be, had his graces flouriſhing, his heart warm, his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions quick and lively, his conſcience pure and tender, his will flexible, and fix'd on God and things ſpiritual, 2 <hi>Ep. Joh.</hi> 8. and a good frame throughout his whole ſoul: but now through
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:132285:191"/> his careleſneſs all is loſt again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 4. One time he loſes the favour and comfortable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 12. another time he loſes a ſweet ſerenity of ſpirit, and peace with God; then light and convictions are gone; another time enjoyments and experiences are gone; now his deſires after God are loſt, then his ſtrength is devoured; now temptations prey upon the ſoul, and then corruptions make a waſte upon it: come to Ordinances, Sermons, Sacraments, and after a great deal of prayer, care, and ſtriving, a little grace and comfort is obtain'd; but through want of watchfulneſs all loſt again: it may be before it ſtirs out of the place, or recovers home to his habitation; the next company, diſcourſe, occaſion, takes away all.</p>
                     <p>Another time God brings the ſoul into the fire of ſome great affliction, ſickneſs, ſuffering, loſſes; and there melts it into ſome holy frames, humility, faith, love, obedience takes off ſome droſs, puts on ſome beauty, imparts ſome ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage; but immediately upon a change of the perſon's condition, when new mercy, health and comfort returns, all the good is loſt again. Now through theſe many and great loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in ſpirituals, which gracious ſouls ſuſtain, they are brought very low, and come to be ſoon poor and beggerly.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Great waſtes, and large expences, help to make Traders poor apace; when they turn ſpendthrifts, and prodigals, living above their eſtates; when their layings out are more than their comings in, this muſt needs bring
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:132285:192"/> them low: It undid the Steward; <hi>He waſted his Maſters goods, Luke</hi> 16. 1. So 'tis with Wiſdom's Merchants alſo, when they turn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals of their graces, mercies, parts, ſtrength, time, and other goods committed to them, ſpending them on their luſts and carnal content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then they ſoon find an alteration.</p>
                     <p>O, at what a rate do men live in point of time! and at what vaſt expences of their ſhort day upon things of no value, talking, eating, drinking, ſleeping, trifling, ſinning away their precious time, as if they had no employment for it, or no better work to do: Little do ſouls think what a ſmall pittance of day-light they have allow'd for their vaſt concerns, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of great employments; and what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs 'tis to be ſo prodigal of this little inch of precious time. O the hours, and days, and years that profeſſing Chriſtians ſpend to no purpoſe! in vain thoughts, fooliſh talking, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent converſes, unprofitable duties and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which when they ſhall be all reckon'd up by the great Creditor, and a bill of waſtes put into the hands of conſcience, and the total ſumm of theſe expences read; what amazing ſenſe! what dreadful impreſs! and fretful ſting will this beget when perſons come to die! As the Queen ſaid, <hi>If her heart were ript open,</hi> Cales <hi>would be found written in it:</hi> So if their hearts could then be as legible as their expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, men might read this there in black, and capital letters, <hi>Loſt time, Loſt time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How great alſo are mens waſtes of graces and peace, wiſdom and capacities, and all for
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:132285:192"/> the obtaining of ſome poor, empty, inſignificant comforts, which periſh with the uſing: There are no locuſts (Chriſtians) like your curſed luſts, which have devoured your precious things; your affections, time, ſtrength and graces; what convictions, reſolutions, hopeful frames, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience-tenderneſs, talents, capacities, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, ordinances, providences, have the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of thy baſe luſts, and contentment of thy carnal mind conſumed! and this hath brought thy ſoul to ſuch ſtraits and diſtreſſing exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                     <p>When ſouls live above their capacities and proportion; that's caſting back, when perſons have little, and yet live high; have but a little light, and yet ſpend that too in works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; have but a ſhort day, and yet ſo many hours of that one day conſumed in vanity; this is to live above thy eſtate, and will be ſoon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhing: When men have but a little grace and ſtrength, and yet adventure upon great temptations, and run into ſoul-ruining dangers, ruſh into vain company, ſet upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling affairs, and take much buſineſs on their hands, and yet have but a little portion of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Grace to manage them; this is to live above thy eſtate in Chriſtianity. To be low of ſtature, and yet high in conceit, of little ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual worth, and yet think highly, and ſpeak highly of thy ſelf, and to expect eſtimation from others alſo, is to live above thy eſtate.</p>
                     <p>To have nothing to maintain thee but what comes in by thy ſoul labours; no longer work, no longer eat; thy daily bread depends upon
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:132285:193"/> thy daily work; ſo poor, and yet in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to expect an eaſie life, to lie down to ſlumber, to dwell careleſly, and ſet thy hand but by fits and ſtarts to thy work: This is to live above thy ſpiritual eſtate, and will ſoon bring thee to breaking in this Heavenly Trade.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Great debts are breaking, and will caſt men back in Wiſdom's Merchandiſe; when men owe more than they are worth, and know not how to pay it; run further on book every day, till their credit will paſs no longer; they have often promiſed payment, but ſtill fail'd, and now their word will not paſs, they can get no more goods, Creditours will not truſt them, but begin to ſuſpect them, and threaten to take them up, then men ſhut up ſhop and break: This alſo is pernicious to Heavenly Traders, when they become unfaithful to God and men, run on ſcore for mercy, but never pay or render to God again; are deep in debt to God for divine goodneſs; receive one mercy after another, one talent after another, and make no returns of any; God ſees not principal or intereſt, but they remain fruitleſs and unthankful under all; make promiſes of better improvements, but ſtill break them: Come to Sacraments, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their Covenant with God, and go away and break it again; make promiſes to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affliction, that if he will deliver them <hi>this once,</hi> they will never grieve and provoke him more as they have done; make large engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if God will hear this prayer, and give that mercy; but when their turn is ſerv'd, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God, and break all their vows again; be
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:132285:193"/> ready to paſs their word on every occaſion, and then look after it no more; this begets a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie in the Lord of Hoſts, that he will truſt them no more, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 21. but hold his hand. and part with no more goods, but threatens to take them up, and to caſt their ſouls into priſon; begins to ſue them in the Court of Conſcience, and to out-law them at the bar of Juſtice, to ſeize on what they have; then away goes peace, joy, hope, and then comes breaking. Theſe are ſome of thoſe reaſons why Chriſtians go back in Religion, and decay in their Heavenly Trade. O Chriſtians! bring the plummet to the line, and thy heart and life to the ballance, and try from which of theſe comes thy ſoul-decaies, and then get it to bear upon thy heart, till thou art fully convinc'd of thy evil, and willing on any terms to obtain remedy.</p>

Forſake your waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waies, and with the prodigal return from your harlots to your Father's houſe, rating your ſelves beneath the leaſt of his mercies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the meaneſt condition, ſo he would but take you in again, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17, 18, 20, 21. Subſcribe all his terms, and make a new ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of your ſelf and your All to Chriſt, to be no more your own, but more entirely his than ever, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 5. Enter into a new Covenant with God in Chriſt, taking him for your Surety, and fetching all your abilities to fulfil it from him, and get thy ſoul more firmly bound to the Lord in it by the bond of the Spirit.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, Set up no more for your ſelves, but enter your ſelves Factors for Chriſt. It may be you traded formerly for your ſelves, and that
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:132285:194"/> broke you; if you would prevent that danger for the future, you muſt be no more for your ſelves, but for him; trading as his Factours, not your own.</p>
                     <p>Now three things are required in a Factor, which muſt be obſerved alſo by wiſdom's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, if ever they will drive a thriving Trade in Godlineſs.</p>

                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, If you will be Chriſt's Factours, you muſt trade upon his ſtock; you muſt not onely take all your goods from him, but as his; not onely fetch in your graces, abilities, skill, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs from him, but uſe and improve them as his, not as your own. <hi>Joh. 1. 16. Of his fulneſs have all we received grace for grace.</hi> 'Twas not onely part of his fulneſs before it was received, but 'tis his grace after reception. <hi>Col. 1. 19. It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell:</hi> not onely the fulneſs of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the fulneſs of habitual grace, both which are in Chriſt; the latter is chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here, which dwells in Chriſt as in a head, not for himſelf onely, but for his body, as beams in the Sun, and water in the Fountain for the uſe of man. The Father hath laid up all that grace that Believers need here and for ever in the Lord Jeſus, as in a Treaſury, or Truſtee's hand, for their uſe; or made it over to him not onely as a deed of gift, but as a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe which he hath bought by his blood for the good and uſe of his children: 'Tis his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:132285:195"/> right and intereſt, but for their uſe and advantage, but ſo as the property and diſpoſal be ſtill his. Fal'n man hath for ever forfeited his credit with God ſince his firſt defection, to become any more the diſpoſer of his intereſts and inheritance, or be intruſted again with his own portion. God deals with ſaved ſouls as parents do with prodigal children, ſecures their eſtates in the hand of a Feoffee. Believers Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are laid up in Chriſt, that ſo grace as well as glory, ſanctification and ſalvation may be ſure to them, and not liable to forfeiture or loſs; to be diſpoſed of, and parted with by them as they pleaſe, but be certainly and eternally theirs, that ſo they may come to Chriſt for all they need, as heirs under age, who have no more in hand than what they want, but muſt come to their Overſeers for all they have uſe of; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſuch, but as Stewards alſo that muſt be accountable for what they have, and how they beſtow it.</p>
                     <p>Poor decay'd ſouls, Would you recover your loſſes, and renew your Trade? then you muſt come to Chriſt's fulneſs, and be beholding to his free grace for all you need. Do you want grace for your duties, places, tryals, ſufferings? come to Chriſt's fulneſs for your ſupplies; ſend to him by the hand of prayer an intimation of all your wants: Make known your requeſts to him. <hi>Phil. 4. 6. Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and ſupplication, with thankſgiving, let your requeſts be made known to God.</hi> Ceaſe not from following God in the Name of Chriſt with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, till the Spirit meet you with returns.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:132285:195"/> The Lord Jeſus hath ordained his people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their ſupplies, ſallaries, and ſtipends from Heaven in the Court of Requeſts. <hi>Matth. 7. 7. Ask, and you ſhall receive. All things whatever you ſhall ask in prayer believing you ſhall receive, Matt.</hi> 21. 22. Seek it by prayer, receive it by faith: Go to Chriſt in the promiſes for all you want, judging him faithful who hath promiſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 11. God's Word is as good as preſent pay, and ſhall be fulfilled by him (who cannot lye) to all that by faith receive it, and wait for its performance. <hi>All his promiſes are in Chriſt Yea and Amen, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 20. Who came down from Heaven to confirm them with his blood, and is returned to Heaven to fulfil them by his interceſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. You may boldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture on divine aſſurance, and ſhall not be aſham'd, if you ſincerely roll on Chriſt in his Word. Be well acquainted with the promiſes, clear up your intereſt in them by believing, and expect their fulfilling through Chriſt. It may be thy graces are low, thy corruptions high, guilt heavy, fears many, refuge fails, thy prayers not anſwered, no good news from Heaven or Earth; thou prayeſt, hopeſt, waiteſt, but no anſwer; in this caſe nothing but firm reliance on divine faithfulneſs, can keep thy head above water.</p>
                     <p>Are you in wants? go to that promiſe, <hi>My God ſhall ſupply all your wants, Phil. 4. 19. God will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly, Pſal. 84. v.</hi> 11. Do you find changes in your ſpirits, and frames, and condition? See that word, <hi>Believe in the Lord your God, and you ſhall be eſtabliſhed;
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:132285:196"/> believe his Prophets, and you ſhall proſper, 2 Chron.</hi> 20. 20. Are corruptions high? apply that word, <hi>He will turn again, he will have compaſſion upon us, he will ſubdue our iniquities, Mic. 7. 19. Sin ſhall have no dominion over you; for you are not under the Law, but under grace, Rom. 6. 14. Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, Titus 2. 14. For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil, Joh. 3. 8. I will ſave her that halteth, Zeph.</hi> 3. 19. When thou ſeeſt nothing but witherings and dyings in thy ſoul, apply theſe promiſes; <hi>So wilt thou recover me, and make me to live, Iſa. 38. 16. The righteous ſhall flouriſh like the Palm-tree, he ſhall grow like the Cedars of Lebanon: Thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our God, thy ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit in old age; they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing, Pſal. 92. 11, 12, 13, 14. I will be as the dew to Iſrael, he ſhall grow as the Lilly, and caſt forth his roots as Lebanon: they that dwell under his ſhadow ſhall return, and ſhall revive as the corn, Hoſ. 14. 5, 6, 7. They that wait on the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, Iſa.</hi> 40. 31. In theſe and ſuch like promiſes, as in wagons ſent of purpoſe to fetch you, go over to your <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and get them laden with the riches of his Kingdom, that you may be relieved and carried on in your Trading for Heaven, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving theſe not as yours, but as your Lord's goods: That's the firſt, Trade upon Chriſt's Stock.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Follow his inſtructions, be guided by his order in the management of your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:132285:196"/> Trade: Take Letters of Advice from your Creditour, how to lay out his moneys, and how to diſpoſe of his goods. <hi>Prov. 3. 5. Lean not to your own underſtanding, which is the moſt cloſe and ſubtil kind of Idolatry</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cartwright) Seek not after your own heart, and your own eyes, after which ye uſe to go a whoring, Numb.</hi> 15. 39. Man is mightily propenſe ſince his firſt defection from God, to take the Scepter into his own hand, and to become the governour of his own waies: But this God cannot bear, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with his Supremacy, and that State alſo into which man is by grace redeemed; which is an abſolute devotedneſs unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5. Ye have likewiſe choſen the Lord to be your Law-giver and King, if you are his, and are now upon your own conſent determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by his pleaſure in every thing you do: The rectitude of every action lies in a conformity to his will, who is your Lord and Soveraign. And as the eyes of a Handmaid wait on her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; ſo ſhould Believers on Chriſt for direction in all they do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122. 3. Chriſtians, your former irregularities in the proſecution of your Heavenly Trade, have almoſt loſt you, and caſt you back: O be more obſervant of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for the future! follow your advice, walk by Rule: <hi>As you have received how you ought to walk, and to pleaſe God; ſo abound more and more, 1 Theſ.</hi> 4. 1. Beg Wiſdom of God to know his Will in every thing, to do that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, having a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for every action you perform both civil and religious; this will be your comfort now,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:132285:197"/> and your peace in the day of your accounts.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Drive on his intereſt, not your own. <hi>Rom. 14. 7. For none of us liveth to himſelf.</hi> God can more juſtly ſay what <hi>Laban</hi> did to <hi>Jacob</hi> concerning his children and goods; <hi>Theſe daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are my daughters, and theſe children are my children, and theſe cattel are my cattel; and all that thou ſeeſt is mine, Gen. 31. 43. The cattel on a thouſand hills are his, Pſal. 50. 10. with the corn, wine, wooll and flax, Hoſ.</hi> 2. 9. Both the improvement as well as principal are his, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 27. He hath right to the exerciſe and fruit of your graces and duties, with all that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy and do: Put Chriſt's mark on all your goods; whatever you gain by his talents, put on his account, and let your disburſments be expended to his uſe. Seek not your own things, your credit, peace, comfort, intereſt, but in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to him: If the Lord by his Word calls for any of your enjoyments, you muſt let them go: If by his Providence he takes off any comfort, murmure not, ſay, 'tis the Lord, Let him do what he will with his own, <hi>Mat. 20. verſe</hi> 15.</p>

                     <head>Advice 1.</head>
                     <p>Firſt, To bleſs God for good trading: Is it well with your ſouls? <hi>Doth the South-wind blow upon your Garden, and the Spices flow out?</hi> Cant. 4. 16. <hi>Doth the Fig-tree put forth her green Figs? and the Vine, with the tender Grape, give a good ſmell? Cant.</hi> 2. 13. What reaſon have you then to be always giving thanks? you whoſe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding turns to any ſpiritual advantage: thou canſt ſay, <hi>'Tis good to draw nigh to God; in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his commands is great reward:</hi> The Lord is not a barren wilderneſs to thy ſoul; <hi>but peace is within thy Walls, and proſperity within thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,</hi> Pſal. 122. 7. <hi>Thy glory is freſh in thee, and thy bow renewed in thy hand: thy root ſpreadeth out by the waters, and the dew lying all night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thy branches,</hi> Job 29. 19, <hi>His ways are pleaſantneſs, and his ſteps drop fatneſs to thy ſoul; and he commands his bleſſing upon thee; and thy faith and love do grow.</hi> Is it thus in any meaſure with thee? O then bleſs the Lord with thy ſoul; let all that is within thee bleſs his holy Name. Make the Lord thy glory, and triumphing praiſe: Thou haſt abundant reaſon to be admiring grace, and exalting divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Becauſe,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Soul-thriving is a great mercy at all times; a little ſpiritual goods is beyond all the World's treaſure; one piece of Chriſt's tried Gold weighs down all the Pearls and Diamonds on earth; and whatever can be found below grace, cannot be compar'd with it, <hi>Job.</hi> 28. 11, 12, 16. or named the ſame day with it: The light
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:132285:198"/> of God's countenance, pardon of ſin, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the ſpirit, fulfilling of Promiſes, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Father, Son, and Spirit; heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breathings after, love to, and delight in God, are things of ineſtimable worth; if you weigh them in themſelves, or with other things; or if you conſider the grace from whence they come, or price which they coſt: Spiritual thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings are an evidence of ſincere love to God. <hi>Judg. 5. 31. Let them that love thy Name be as the Sun that goeth forth in his might,</hi> and of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love in God to that ſoul, <hi>Tit. 3. 4, 6. Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 5, 7. God may proſper in the World thoſe he hates; <hi>Eſau</hi> had his fat things here, but grace and peace are new-covenant-bleſſings, which ſpring from eternal love in the heart of God to that ſoul, <hi>Heb. 8. 10. Zech.</hi> 8. 11, 12, 15.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, 'Tis a ſingular mercy at this time, a mercy that few enjoy in the day we live in: What a rare thing is it, in this long winter, to ſee a green Olive, a tender Grape appear, or Pomgranate bud? <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 6. or one Berry in the uppermoſt branch, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 13. It was a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar glory put upon the head of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> that ſhe was thriving when other Churches were decaying: <hi>She had works, and works, and the last were more than the firſt, Rev. 2. 19. Epheſus</hi> had loſt her firſt love; <hi>Sardis</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed and waſted her firſt ſtrength, and was ready to die: <hi>Laodicea</hi> was luke-warm, ready to be ſpued out by the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1, 8, 16. only <hi>Thyatira</hi> flouriſhed exceedingly, and grew in the winter; and this honour ſhe
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:132285:199"/> had, to have it recorded by the Spirit for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument in after-ages. 'Tis not the lot of every one to thrive in evil times; few <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> whoſe faith and love did grow, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 3. A ſingle <hi>Timothy,</hi> who had flouriſhing affections to the things of Chriſt; <hi>I have no man like minded, Phil.</hi> 2. 20. One <hi>Gaius,</hi> whoſe ſoul out-proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered his body, 3 <hi>Ep. Joh. v.</hi> 2. A flouriſhing Chriſtian this day is like a flower in winter, an Apple-tree amongſt the trees of the wood: Surely, if there be a Soul who this day flouriſhes to any heighth of Chriſtianity, who lives in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy with God, fares deliciouſly in his ſoul, feeding on marrow, and hidden <hi>manna;</hi> that he or ſhe is greatly beloved of God. Thy lot, O ſoul, is fal'n in a peculiar plot of mercies ground; and ſhould not the Lord Jeſus be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd of ſuch a one, ſeeing he is come to him in the fulneſs of the bleſſing of the Goſpel? O bleſs God for this unſpeakable gift!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, 'Tis an earneſt of eternal mercy: They that ſow to the ſpirit ſhall reap life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 8. And ſuch as abound in holineſs, ſhall have an abundant entrance adminiſtred to them into the Kingdom of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, 2 <hi>Tet.</hi> 1. 11.

The Lord's ripe fruit ſhall be gathered, not ſhaken on the ground; and ſafely hous'd in Heaven.

                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:132285:199"/>
                     <p>Poor troubled Soul, God will not deſpiſe the day of thy ſmall things, much leſs thy ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enlargements after him; he will be tender of thy ſmalleſt bloſſoms, and ſecure them into fruit; much more ſhall thy encreaſes arrive to the fulneſs of the meaſure of the ſtature of Chriſt, <hi>Eph. 4. 15. God is not unrighteous to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get your work and labour of love, which you have ſhewn towards his name, Heb.</hi> 6. 10. It may be thou haſt forgotten many a duty and hearty teſtimony of thy love to Chriſt, his name, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ways; and canſt ſee nothing in all thou haſt done, but art ready to ſay on every turn; <hi>When ſaw I thee an hunger'd, and fed thee? or thirſty, and gave thee drink? when ſaw I thee a ſtranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? or ſick, and in priſon, and came to thee? Matth.</hi> 25. 35. But God cannot be ſo unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to forget it, or let it paſs ſo; but keeps a record of all thy meaneſt duties, and will make the moſt of them in the day of righteous judgment. <hi>I know thy works, and thy labours, and thy patience, &amp;c.</hi> Rev. 2. 2. <hi>When thou waſt under the Fig-tree I ſaw thee, Joh.</hi> 1. 48. He takes notice of a <hi>Daniel</hi> by the river <hi>Hiddekel;</hi> of a <hi>Peter</hi> on the houſe-top; of <hi>Elijah</hi> under the Juniper-tree, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 4, 5. yea, of what was but in <hi>David</hi>'s heart to do, and requites it, 8 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 18.

O then be bleſſing God for the leaſt good he

There are no offerings come up with that acceptance on God's Altar, as thankſgiving-offerings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 30, 31.

No ſuch thriving ſouls, as God-praiſing ſouls: <hi>Jer. 31. 12. Therefore they ſhall come, and ſing in the heighth of</hi> Sion; <hi>and ſhall flow together to the goodneſs of the Lord for Wheat, and for Wine, and for Oil; and their ſoul ſhall be as a watred Garden, and they ſhall not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row any more at all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> How might I know whether I have good trading in Spirituals or no, that I might have ground for rejoycing in God? Could I find this ſoul-welfare you ſpeak of, I ſhould bleſs God with my whole ſoul; but I fear 'tis otherwiſe; that I am one of thoſe who fall back, and decay in my heavenly Trade.</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> There are ſeven ſigns of good Trading, eſpecially in evil times; which men uſually reckon to be diſcoveries of a thriving Trade.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When men go not back in the World, but hold their own, they loſe nothing: 'Tis much in bad times to keep ones ground; to be ſavers in ſuch a ſeaſon is a piece of gain: Try in this how 'tis with you; do not you go back in your ſpiritual eſtate? is it not worſe with you than heretofore? Is not your faith, love, humility, patience leſs than heretofore?
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:132285:200"/> If you go not back in grace, you go forward; there's no ſtanding at a ſtay in Religion, men go forward or backward in the way of Vertue; they that do not decay, do thrive in Spirituals: <hi>Job</hi> proves his good eſtate by his ſtanding faſt in ſhaking times: <hi>Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lip; I have eſteemed the words of his mouth more than my neceſſary food: My foot hath held his ſteps; his way have I kept, and not declined,</hi> Job 23. 10, 11, 12. and thence concludes a gainful iſſue: <hi>When he hath tried me, I ſhall come forth as Gold.</hi> And the Apoſtle reckons it good profit, in ſoul-conflicts, to ſtand ones ground; if he cannot gain, yet not to loſe: <hi>But having done all, to ſtand, is victory, Eph.</hi> 6. 13. Chriſtians have their winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſons, when growing is not viſible; then to keep alive, is commendable. Do you hold faſt your integrity? and keep your garments on? Do you preſerve your conſcience pure from the defilements and temptations of the day and place you live in? and your hearts unſpotted from the World? your deſires as warm, your purpoſes of cleaving to God as firm, and your feet as quick to run the way of God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments as heretofore? then have you good trading, conſidering the times you live in, which is an hour of temptation, and an evening of darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If wares go off well, 'tis good trading; when goods vend at a good rate, men count it thriving. Is it ſo with your ſouls? do your prayers come up to God with acceptance? do duties turn to any profit to you? what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:132285:201"/> have you of your religious ſervices? do hearing, prayer, conference, bring you any ſoul-advantage? do not goods lie by you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed of? but your graces are exerciſed, your talents, gifts, opportunities, improv'd; then 'tis good Trading. If the Lord give you light, you lay it out for the good of others; if he reſtore to you the joy of his ſalvation, and uphold you with his free Spirit, you teach tranſgreſſours his waies, and endeavour to convert ſinners to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 12, 13. When God drops in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to you, you pour it forth to others, that they may be comforted alſo with the ſame comforts wherewith you are comforted of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4. When you are come to duties publick or private, do graces go out in them? you ſhew parts it may be, but do you lay out grace as well as gifts, ſpiritual as well as natural affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? Do you pray with the Spirit, and hear with Faith? do hope, fear, humility, holy ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, heavenly breathings, ſincerity, go off in your religions duties? when you meet with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, what goods do you put off to them? Do you labour in every ſociety to vend ſomething of heavenly wares, to put off ſome holy counſel and inſtruction, ſome gracious experience and obſervation, to leave ſomething behind you in every place and company you come, that may faſten a ſavour of God on them? then is it good Trading, and you are in a ſoul-thriving way.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Men count it good Trading, when they are richer in ſtock, when they have more goods, more variety, greater quantity of wares, than firſt they had, and that clear too, and paid
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:132285:201"/> for; their ſhops and warehouſes are fuller than they were, and the goods their own alſo; this men reckon good Trading: And can you ſay 'tis thus with your ſouls alſo? Are you increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſpiritual goods? your graces are more as well as gifts, your faith, love, hope, fear, are more grown, and ſtronger than they were, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 3. Can you truſt God more than you could, and hang upon a naked promiſe more ſtrongly than you could, when ſight fails? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. Can you think well of God when he frowns upon you? Can you love him when he corrects you? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39. 8, Can you ſtay on him when he ſtrips you of your viſible comforts, and cleave to him when he ſeems to reject you? <hi>Job 13. v.</hi> 15. Then are you richer in ſtock.</p>
                     <p>Is your Faith more cleanſing and quickening, your Love more warming, your Zeal more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, your Hope more adventurous, your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience more bearing, your Joy more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, your Humility more ſelf-abaſing? then are you encreaſed with goods. Have you more of every grace; it may be at firſt you had much affection, but little ſincerity; great deſires, but little faith; much comfort, but little patience and ſelf-denial; you could pray, talk, rejoyce, do ſome duties, but could not bear trials, want comforts, live by faith when ſight failed; you were much it may be in ſome duties, but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in others; but now you have more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of graces, enlargement in duties, and more univerſal reſpect to all God's commands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 6. And if you are leſs in the bulk of duty, you are more in the ſpirit of it; when 'tis thus,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:132285:202"/> there's a thriving Trade in Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Are you leſs in debt than you were? that's another ſign of good Trading: Do you make conſcience of rendring to God again for all his benefits? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 12, 13. Is it your trouble when you are behind-hand with grace, and fall in arreer to the mercy of God by your unthankfulneſs? <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 10. Indeed, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the grace of God you are defective; to make requitals of mercies you cannot; you ſee poſſibly an infinite ſhortneſs in your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of the meaneſt favour that the Lord beſtows upon you; but ſuch as you have, you give to the Lord; you render all poſſible praiſes, though not all praiſes due, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 2. This you are careful of, and charge upon your hearts every day, to walk as becometh the grace that brings ſalvation, and the mercies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on you: 'tis the deſire of your heart and labour, to walk worthy of God to all well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, and to anſwer the end of mercy in which you are willing beyond your ability, and grieve at your falling ſhort herein: Now this doth the Lord count for the deed, and accept at his peoples hands, as full pay, through the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. And where 'tis thus that perſons live in the daily ſenſe of Divine Grace, and grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of every mercy, there is a thriving Trade in ſpirituals.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Have you much owed you, and is it ſecure? This alſo beſpeaks a thriving Trade: Men count ſure debts as good as ready money; though they have little in bags, yet if they have
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:132285:202"/> the more in book, and good debt too, they rate themſelves accordingly, and reckon themſelves worth ſo much as is due, as well as to what is in hand: And is it ſo with you Chriſtians? are you rich in promiſes? is much coming to you upon a new-covenant ſcore? It may be you have little in hand, little comfort, peace and ſweetneſs you meet with from day to day: You ſow much, but reap little; you ask, but have not, and yet ſeek with your whole heart: Goods are received, but no money returned; if ſo, you have good grounds of hope for a plentiful harveſt, becauſe you ſow ſtore of good ſeed; are much in holy duties, and ſincere in them; many a prayer upon the file, many a tear drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into God's bottle, much grace laid out in duty, and time ſpent in it, a daily care to pleaſe God, and upon Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds can lay claim to many a promiſe on the account of Chriſt: What you ſow, you ſhall reap, <hi>Gal. 6. 8. Your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord, 2 Cor. 15. v. 58. Say unto the righteous, it ſhall be well with them, for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings, Iſa.</hi> 3. 10. And the leſs is received, the more is behind. Improvements of grace do book down many a mercy for Believers, which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they may not receive all their life, and yet be ſure, and turns to account in the Inheritance prepared for them; and this is good Trading which brings in bonds and bills that are ſure, and ſhall be paid to Heavenly Traders in their own Countrey.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That's good Trading where the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent incomes maintain the Trader, and ſo much
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:132285:203"/> is got by it as they may live by; when a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can live comfortably upon his gettings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impairing the ſtock: If it be ſo with the Believer in thy Heavenly Trade, then haſt thou good Trading.

                     <p>Seventhly, Layings up, as well as layings out beſpeaks good Trading, when men fill their bags and enlarge their poſſeſſions, turn Purchaſers, and begin to join houſe to houſe, and field to field, then they manifeſtly ſhew their thrivings: So when Souls thrive in their Heavenly Trade, they begin to lay up for Heaven, and to be preparing for another world; they lay up Treaſure in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 21. get bags that wax not old: weak Chriſtians are all for their comforts here, how they may maintain their peace and pleaſure in the way; but ſtrong Chriſtians, thriving Souls, they have their thoughts upon their journeys end, and to make proviſions for their future ſtate: Bread and Water contents them here, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 20. a little ſpending Money in the way to help them home is all they indent for: But their chiefeſt care is to lay up for Heaven; <hi>When ſhall I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for mine own houſe, ſaith Jacob,</hi> Gen. 30. 30? So the thriving Chriſtian is thoughtful about his houſe in Heaven, to make all the proviſions he can for that; he will lay up in ſtore a good foundation to lay hold on eternal life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 19. he is for ſecuring all he can for Heaven, and for ſuch works as will follow him; he will turn all he may into moveables, that he may tranſmit them into his Countrey. The intereſts of this world are ſtak'd down to the earth, and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:132285:204"/> cannot be removed; but thriving Chriſtians are for ſuch goods as they can knock up, and carry with them to their own home: They ſtrive to pray, hear, think, ſpeak, do, ſuffer, and all for eternity: their affections are gone before to Heaven, while their bodies are impriſon'd in the World.

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> There are four things which uſually make men thriving in their earthly Trades; which do alſo contribute to proſperity in this heavenly Merchandiſe.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 <hi>A provident care.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, Men that are thriving in the World are provident and careful to prevent their dangers, to ſecure their intereſts, and proportion means to their advantage. And ſo muſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that think ever to flouriſh in godlineſs: what loſſes and miſcarriages in Religion might a provident care prevent? were temptations way-laid, and corruptions timely guarded againſt, ſouls might eſcape many ſurpriſals of ſin, and abatements in grace: Never think to proſper in holineſs, till you are provident to prevent its weaknings, and contribute all you may towards its ſtrength and enlargement. One enjoys a good frame of ſoul, much peace and joy in believing; and for want of watchfulneſs loſeth all again. Another hath got a little pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over his corruptions for a time, and for want of a provident care to avoid enſnaring occaſions, is overcome again. Another hath a choice advantage put into his hand for ſpiritual good, but not exerciſing a timely care and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to improve it, miſcarries in all his hopes and labours; and by theſe changes and interruptions their ſpiritual welfare is impeded:
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:132285:205"/> 
                        <hi>Go learn of the Ant, ſhe provideth her meat in Summer, Prov.</hi> 6. 6, 8. Be wiſe as Serpents, they decline danger as ſoon as ſeen, and guard their nobleſt part, though with the hazard of their All, <hi>Matth. 19. 16. Walk circumſpectly as wiſe, Eph.</hi> 5. 15. O how happy might Chriſtians be, were they as provident for their ſouls as they are for their bodies! and did exerciſe their reaſon, care and fore-ſight to further their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual intereſts; and without this provident care, never think to proſper in this heavenly Merchandiſe. Take heed of grace-waſting ſins, of any ſecret luſt allowed, or ſweet morſel rouled under your tongue, that will prove a moth in your ſpiritual eſtate, and keep you low in your heavenly intereſts. Souls under ſome perplexing luſt, are like <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing hand of <hi>Midian</hi> againſt them, <hi>Judg. 6. 3, 4, 6. When</hi> Iſrael <hi>had ſown, the</hi> Midianites <hi>came up, and the</hi> Amalekites, <hi>and the children of the Eaſt, and they encamped againſt them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the encreaſe of the earth, and left no ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for</hi> Iſrael, <hi>neither Sheep, nor Ox, nor Aſs;—and</hi> Iſrael <hi>was greatly impoveriſhed:</hi> So 'tis with ſuch; no ſooner have they got any mercy, frame, experience, hope, or ſoul-advantage, but preſently a prevailing luſt riſeth up, and deſtroys all: Cry unto the Lord as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, until he deliver you from every iniquity: make no peace with any corruption, never let it reſt till whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed if you think to proſper in your ſouls and converſations. Be provident alſo to take all advantages for godlineſs, watching your opportunities for every duty, keeping every
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:132285:205"/> ſoul-market and fair, and taking the beſt ſeaſon to lay out grace, and get in profit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 34. Be careful to get ſome good from every thing, and to keep and ſave what you have; and this will tend to ſoul-thriving, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 46.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A diligent hand tends to thriving; men that proſper in the World take pains, and follow their employments; riſing early, ſitting up late, neglecting no buſineſs that may help on to profiting. So muſt you that intend to thrive in Religion; you muſt make it your buſineſs, you muſt be labourers in God's Vineyard, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. and workmen indeed that need not be aſhamed, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. Chriſtians for the moſt part are too ſlothful in their ſpiritual buſineſs, to have their profiting appear: it will coſt you more ſtriving to enter into the ſtrait-gate, and get ground in the narrow way that leads to life; more blows muſt paſs before your enemies will down, and more ſtrokes at your work before your intereſts will come in: Running, ſtriving, wreſtling; in labours more abundant, in weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and painfulneſs, in watchings: What pains will men take for the World? <hi>She riſeth alſo while it is night,—Her candle goeth not out by night: That neither day nor night ſeeth ſleep with his eyes. Ye compaſs Sea and Land;</hi> and ſhould they not much more for Heaven? The moſt diligent ſoul is the moſt thriving ſoul; <hi>Always abounding in the work of the Lord;</hi> inſtant <hi>in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon;</hi> taking every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for Heaven: <hi>And what their hand finds to do, to do it with all their might;</hi> this is the way to ſoul-thriving, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 24, 25. Heb.</hi>
                        <pb n="376" facs="tcp:132285:206"/> 12. 4. <hi>Eph. 6. 12. 1 Cor. 11. 23, 27. Prov. 31. 15. 18. Eccleſ. 8. 16. Matth. 23. 15. Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 10.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Driving a ſecret Trade of holineſs, is ſoul-thriving: Men that have ſome peculiar art, and unknown myſtery in their Trade which is not ordinary and common, uſually get great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cuſtom and advantage: So is it in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Trade; the more men are taken up in the myſteries of Godlineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. the more they thrive in Religion. There's a ſecret in holineſs, which no ſtranger intermeddles with, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 10. There's a way within the veil; the hidden part in which ſouls are made to know wiſdom; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 6. Hidden riches of ſecret places, which thriving Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans meet with, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 3. If you would proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Godlineſs, be ſure to maintain the ſecret duties of piety: The religion of moſt men lies in the Market place, and in the view of others; their hearts, their cloſets are not privy to any ſecret tranſactions between God and their ſouls; and in the praiſe of men they have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: but the thriving trade of Chriſtianity, is the ſecret trade. Chriſtians be moſt in thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which men leaſt obſerve, and chiefly excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the inviſible part of your viſible work: Publick duties are moſt honourable, but ſecret duties the moſt gainful. <hi>Matth. 6. 4. And thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward thee openly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The bleſſing of God maketh rich: <hi>Prov. 10. 22. Promotion cometh not from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt;</hi> nor proſperity from mens fingers ends, but from God's hand. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:132285:206"/> 8, 10, 11, 12. <hi>The Lord ſhall command his bleſſing upon thee; in thy ſtore-houſes, and in all which thou ſetteſt thy hand unto:—The Lord ſhall make thee plenteous in goods:—The Lord ſhall open to thee his good treaſures; the Heavens to give thee rain to thy Land in his ſeaſon, and to bleſs all the work of thy hand:</hi> (and then comes riches) <hi>And thou ſhalt lend udto many Nations, and thou ſhalt not borrow:</hi> Proſperity, both ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and temporal, comes at God's ſending: <hi>Pſal. 118. 25. O Lord, I beſeech thee, ſend now proſperity:</hi> Pſal. 18. 32, 33. <hi>He reſtoreth my Soul, he leadeth me in the paths of righteouſneſs:</hi> Pſal. 23. 3, 5. <hi>Thou anointeſt my head with Oil: Thou bleſſeſt the ſpringing thereof; thy paths drop fatneſs:</hi> Pſal. 65. 10, 11. <hi>The Lord ſhall guide thee continually, and ſatisfy thy ſoul in drought, and make fat thy bones; and thou ſhalt be like a watred Garden, and like a ſpring of water, whoſe waters fail not,</hi> Iſa, 58. 11. <hi>I will be as the dew to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>he ſhall grow as the Lilly, and caſt forth his root as</hi> Lebanon, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 5. Secure an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the promiſes, and get your ſouls brought under the ſhowers of bleſſing, if ever you think to thrive in godlineſs. Improve thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving graces, and take proſperous courſes; theſe are under a promiſe of bleſſing: though every grace and duty do in their meaſure help on ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſperity, yet there are ſome graces and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have a more ſpecial influence on ſpiritual thrivings.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Faith is a ſoul-proſpering grace: 2 <hi>Chr. 20. 20. Believe in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall ye be eſtabliſhed: believe his Prophets, ſo ſhall ye
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:132285:207"/> proſper.</hi> Eph. 6. 16. <hi>Above all take the ſhield of Faith, wherewith ye ſhall quench all the fiery darts of Satan,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>inſuper, Bez.</hi> Every grace is uſeful in the ſpiritual warfare, but Faith eſpecially: other graces may (with <hi>Saul</hi>) ſlay their thouſands; but Faith (with <hi>David</hi>) ſlays its ten thouſands: Some darts may be quenched by other graces, but Faith quenches fiery darts, yea all the fiery darts of Satan, which does wonderfully further thriving: <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith, Heb.</hi> 10. 38. Faith will maintain the ſoul's life in the greateſt ſtraits and exigences: Faith is a receiving grace, it takes in whatever is laid up in the promiſe; and that's thriving. <hi>Gal. 3. 22. That the promiſe by Faith might be given to them that believe.</hi> A ſoul-enriching grace, <hi>rich in Faith, Jam.</hi> 2. 5. A working grace, <hi>And the work of Faith with power, 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 4. A powerful grace; it gives the ſoul experience of the mighty power of God. <hi>Eph. 1. 19. 20. What is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to usward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, 1 Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. 'Tis a ſtrengthning grace: <hi>Out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were made ſtrong, Heb.</hi> 11. 34. through it doth the Lord let out his abundant grace: <hi>And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant with faith and love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 14. It doth exceedingly nouriſh the ſoul in grace, and edify it to ſalvation: 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 6. Nouriſhed up in the words of Faith, 1. Tim. 1, 4. Which miniſter queſtions rather than edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is in Faith:</hi> One reaſon why ſouls
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:132285:207"/> proſper no more in piety is their unbelief; they are full of doubtings, fears, and queſtionings upon every turn, ſtill wavering as a wave of the Sea; ſuch cannot receive much at the hand of God, but are ſtill weak, and going back in Religion. Be much in believing the promiſes againſt hope, and above fears, if ever you think to proſper in Religion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Love to God, his Name, ways and intereſt is a Soul-proſpering Grace. <hi>Let them that love him, be as the Sun that goeth forth in his might:</hi> Judg. 5. 31. <hi>They ſhall proſper that love thee,</hi> Pſal. 122. 6. <hi>Let them alſo that love thy name be joyful in thee, for thou Lord wilt bleſs the righteous, with favour wilt thou compaſs him as with a Shield,</hi> Pſal. 5. 11, 12. Love to God muſt needs be a proſpering Grace, becauſe it brings the Soul under the bleſſing of God, and within the compaſs of his ſecuring Shield, Love is a Soul-ſtrengthning and eſtabliſhing Grace. <hi>Eph. 3. 17, Being rooted and grounded in Love,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ſet in a firm ground, not eaſily ſhaken from God or their integrity. Love makes a growing Soul. <hi>Eph. 4. 15, Speaking the truth in love may grow up in him, who is the head in all things.</hi> It helps on edification in Grace, <hi>ver. 16. maketh encreaſe of the body unto the edifying of it ſelf in love:</hi> Love conſtrains the Soul after God, makes his commands plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and quickens the heart to make haſt in the way to Glory; the more you love God, the more will you proſper in Godlineſs.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Humility is a Soul-proſpering Grace, and under a promiſed Bleſſing. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 23,

                        <hi>ſhall bear him up from falling, and bring him unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> (ſaith <hi>Montanus</hi>) Prov. 15. 33, <hi>By humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are riches and honour:</hi> The humble Soul muſt needs be a thriving Soul, for God giveth Grace to it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 6. yea, dwelleth with the humble to revive the Spirit of the humble, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 15. There's a great deal of Pride in moſt Chriſtians, and that hinders Soul-thriving, proud of Parts and Grace, proud under ſeeming humility, proud of humility; Low Valleys are fruitful, when lofty Mountains are barren: <hi>The rich ſit in a low place:</hi> Eccl. 10. 6, <hi>Such as are rich in wiſdom</hi> 
                        <note n="l" place="bottom">

                        <hi>folly is ſet in great dignity:</hi> Poor, fooliſh, empty Creatures, they are high in conceit as well as place, many times; but the moſt rich and thriving Souls, theſe are pooreſt in Spirit, and loweſt in their own eyes; the richer the Metal, the heavier; Gold weighs down Silver and Tin; the fuller of fruits bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are, the more they bow: <hi>He ſendeth the ſprings into the valleys,</hi> Pſal. 104. 10. Pſal. 65. 13. <hi>They are covered over with Corn:</hi> Vineyards thrive beſt in low places: One branch of Grapes from the Valley of <hi>Eſhcol,</hi> was ſaid to be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for two men, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 23. would you flouriſh in Grace? take heed of Pride: <hi>Pride in the Soul,</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>is like the ſpleen in the body, when that ſwelleth, all the other parts lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh: 'tis poiſon at the root of the tree, which

                     <p>Fourthly, Another choice fruit of the Spirit which will further Soul-thriving, is ſincerity: <hi>Prov. 14. 11, The tabernacle of the upright ſhall flouriſh: They ſhall have good things in poſſeſſion,</hi> Prov. 28. 10. they ſhall not only be preſerv'd from evil, and eſcape the pit into which the wicked fall; but ſhall be ſure to meet with good; Bleſſings, good things ſhall be given to them as their inheritance, as <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> interpret it, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                        </gap>, <hi>Thou ſheweſt mercy to thy Servants, that walk before thee with all their heart,</hi> 2 Chron. 6. 14. <hi>He that hath clean hands and a pure heart, who hath not lift up his Soul to vanity, nor ſworn deceitfully, he ſhall receive the bleſſing from the Lord, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the God of his Salvation,</hi> Pſal. 24. 4, 5.

'tis not thy many Duties before God, but the Oneneſs of thy heart with God: nor the bulk of thy Services, but the ſincerity of thy Soul, which will make thee profperous in thy heavenly intereſts.</p>
                     <p>Again, Take thriving courſes, proſperous ways, as well as proſpering Graces, theſe are under a promiſed Bleſſing alſo. Not to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply particulars: There are four thriving ways in which Chriſtians may attain to a proſperous Trade in Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>The way of
<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>Self-Examination.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>3. <hi>Enjoyment of God.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>4. <hi>Obedience.</hi>
                           </item>

                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Be often examining; and calling your ſelves to an account how matters ſtand with your Souls: Traders that would be thriving will be often viewing their Books, and trying their Accompts, and have ſome ſet days, when they ſurvey their Goods, caſt up their Books, and try whether they gain, or loſe; and ſo muſt Chriſtians that would profit in Religion, they muſt be often judging themſelves, that they be not judged, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31. they muſt caſt up their accompts, and try their ſtate whether they go forward or backward: <hi>Hag. 1. 5. Conſider your ways:</hi> try how the caſe ſtands with you, whether you get or loſe, and what's the cauſe of all thoſe blaſtings that are upon you, <hi>Pſal. 4. 4, Commune with your hearts upon your beds, and be ſtill:</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5, <hi>Examine your ſelves whether
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:132285:209"/> you be in the faith, prove your own ſelves; know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you except you be reprobates.</hi> The neglect of this examination is one cauſe of that great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of perſons about their Soul-ſtate, ſome thinking themſelves better, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. others judging themſelves worſe than they are: which begets ſecurity in ſome, diſcouragement in others, error and floth in all. A right eſtimate of thy ſpiritual capacity, either poverty or riches, gain or loſs is abſolutely needful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate thy duty unto a right affecting of thy heart, and advance of thy ſpiritual intereſts: Look over the Day-book of thy heart and life every night, poſting all thy accompts on the large book of thy Conſcience, and take ſome ſpecial time for a more full ſurvey of thy Soul and ſtate for Eternity; this will be of good uſe to further Soul-thriving.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If you would proſper in your Souls, be much and mighty with God in Prayer: 'Tis ſaid of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> that <hi>he ſought God in the days of Zechariah, who had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the viſions of God, and as long as he ſought the Lord, God made him to proſper,</hi> 2 Chron. 26. 5. Right Prayer is a wonderful way to Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enrichings: <hi>He</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>can never be poor that can pray well:</hi> One reaſon why this King proſpered as long as he ſought the Lord, was, by this means he came to the <hi>viſions of God,</hi> and that help'd him to take a right way to proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. By Prayer you adviſe with God, what courſe to take towards mercy: 'tis your Ephod by which you ask counſel of God where to go
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:132285:210"/> to ſhun danger, and what to do to carry on Duty, and obtain Mercy, 2 <hi>Sam. 23. 6. 9. Chap.</hi> 30. 7. and by Prayer you procure and get out the Graces and Supplies you need, 1 <hi>Chron, 4. 10, And Jabeſh called on the God of Iſrael, ſaying, O that thou wouldſt bleſs me indeed, and enlarge my coaſts, and that thine hand might be with me, and that thou wouldſt keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me:</hi> and God granted him that he requeſted. Prayer brings down the Spirit ſometimes inſenſible and almoſt intolerable meaſures thereof. When that precious Servant of the Lord Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> (of whom King <hi>James</hi> ſaid he was worthy of the half of his Kingdom) had ſadly repreſented the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches caſe, then under eminent danger, there was ſuch a ſenſible down-pouring of the Spirit, that they could hardly contain themſelves; yea, an unuſual motion on thoſe who were in other parts of the houſe, not knowing the cauſe of it at that time. O what great things did <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Jacob, Moſes, Jehoſhaphat, Samuel, Elijah,</hi> and other Servants of God, get out of the hand of God! <hi>Luther</hi> was a mighty man in Prayer, 'tis ſaid of him, he could get of God what he would, <note n="n" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Ille vir potuit quod voluit.</hi>
                        </note> nothing is too hard for Faith and Prayer, becauſe it ſeeks nothing but what God is willing to ſpare, and hath promiſed to give: Labour to get a mighty Spirit of Prayer; the gift of Prayer will not do, it muſt be the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prayer, which is a pure, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanſing Spirit, and cannot dwell with the leaſt regarded Sin: Gifts of Prayer with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:132285:210"/> affections may be mighty on the Spirits of men, but are no way prevailing with God for the Bleſſing: 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Naaman, He was a mighty man in valour, but he was a leper,</hi> 2 Kings 5. 1. So there are ſome that ſeem mighty men in Prayer, and can wonderfully raife the affections of others; pray like Angels, but all the while are <hi>Lepers,</hi> under the ruling power of ſome ſecret luſt; pride, paſſion, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſnneſs, uncleanneſs, and the like, which they hide vnder their tongue; but ſuch are far from this mighty power of prayer, which brings down the Spirit on their own hearts or others. Ah Chriſtians! if you would proſper in grace, get and improve the Spirit of Grace and Supplication.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Another thriving way is to engage God with you in all your undertakings. 'Twas this made <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſo proſperous in all he did; God was with him. <hi>Gen. 39. 23. Becauſe the Lord was with him; and that which he did, he made it to proſper:</hi> 2 Sam. 5. 10. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>went on, and grew great, and the Lord God of Hoſts was with him:</hi> 'Twas not his wiſdom, valour, nor any means he uſed, but the gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God with him that made him to grow ſo great: This made <hi>Solomon</hi> to proſper; 2 <hi>Chron. 22. 11. Now my Son, the Lord be with thee, and proſper thee.</hi> When perſons loſe the gracious preſence of God, they ſoon find an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, and begin to wither and decay in their ſoul-comforts and proſperity: <hi>Thou did'ſt hide thy face, and I was troubled, Pſal.</hi> 30. 6. Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled like <hi>a withered flower, that loſeth ſap and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:132285:211"/> vigour,</hi> [Mr. <hi>Leigh.] Jonah</hi> ſoon found a change in his ſoul; it ceaſed to be with him as before, when once he fled from the preſence of God: He never had a good day after he loſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, but ſtorms, tempeſts, ſhipwrack of peace, ſafety and proſperity, and a caſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deeps of diſtreſs, and ruining dangers, <hi>Jonah.</hi> 1. 3, 10. Ah Chriſtians! as you love your ſouls, and your ſpiritual welfare, take heed of loſing God's gracious preſence; whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſoever you loſe, keep the Lord's preſence with you; abide with him, and he will abide with you: 2 <hi>Chron. 15. 2. The Lord is with you while you be with him; and if you ſeek him, he will be found of you: Put away the unclean thing, and he will dwell in you, and walk in you, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 16. Love him, and keep his commandments, and he will take up his abode with you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 23. Content not your ſelves with any priviledg except you have God with you: <hi>If thy preſence go not with us, carry us not up hence, Exod. 33. 15. I proteſt</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Bruce,</hi> when wreſtling for the preſence of God with him in his going to preach) <hi>I will not go except thou go with me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Follow the counſel of God, if you would thrive in the work and way of God: <hi>Joſh. 1. 8. This Book of the Law ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou ſhalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayeſt obſerve to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that is written therein; for then thou ſhalt make thy way proſperous, and then thou ſhalt have good ſucceſs:</hi> Jer. 38. 20. <hi>Obey, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, the voice of the Lord which I ſpeak unto thee; ſo it ſhall be well unto thee, and thy ſoul
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:132285:211"/> ſhall live.</hi> One cauſe why men proſper no more in Religion, is, that little conſcience they make of doing the will of God: men hear, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the word; others know their Lord's will, but prepare not themſelves to do it. We live in an age of notions, not of motion after God; like men that ſee Countries in a Map, but care not to travel into them; bare knowledg plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth moſt: Mens zeal after truth, is like <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi>'s love to his Father <hi>David,</hi> only to ſee him, not to ſerve him: 2 <hi>Sam. 14. 32. Let me ſee the King's face;</hi> which he no ſooner did, but conſpired againſt him: So moſt care for no more than to behold truth, not to dwell with it; and hence 'tis that proſperity is ſuch a ſtranger to them: 'Twas not directions could heal <hi>Naaman</hi> of his leproſy, but obedience; he was never the better till he followed the Prophet's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and waſhed in <hi>Jordan:</hi> that which made the ground rain'd upon, to be nigh to curſing, was not bringing forth fruit meet for them, by whom 'twas dreſſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 8. Do not only ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but walk after the truth, if you think to proſper in Religion, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 25. The doers of the word ſhall be bleſſed in their deed.</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 'Tis the deſire of my ſoul to live in the exerciſe of every grace, and diſcharge of every duty; and ſome weak endeavours I have had, though too too ſhort; with many cries for this ſoul-proſperity, but cannot yet attain unto it: Methinks I am like a wither'd arm, a dry tree, and barren womb, nothing doth me good; no food, ſeed or ſhowers make me thriving and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:132285:212"/> 
                        <hi>fruitful: I fear I ſhall be at laſt cut down, and bundled for the fire.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Firſt, Thou mayeſt thrive in Religion, and not know it for a ſeaſon; thy profiting may be, though not appear: The Tradeſman may bring home gain in his purſe, though untold: men know not their gettings till they caſt up their accounts: thy proſperity may be as a casked Jewel, and friend under diſguiſe. If you would eſtimate your advantage, ſurvey your ſelves, compare your preſent with your former ſtate; what were you? what are you? ſpeak out ſoul: was there not a time when thou wert blind, thou could'ſt ſee no evil in ſin, nor excellency in grace? but now thy eye is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and things appear otherwiſe to thy ſoul than they did: Now there is nothing ſo vile as thy wicked heart, and waies; and nothing ſo deſirable as Chriſt and holineſs.</p>
                     <p>Thou wert once dead in ſin, thou did'ſt not feel or fear any hurt in it, or danger by it; but now 'tis otherwiſe: thou can'ſt not ſin, but thy conſcience ſmites thee: nor God threaten, but it affrights thee: thy quick-ey'd conſcience ſoon eſpies the leaſt failing in thy duty, falſeneſs in thy heart, or error in thy life; and, as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant, arreſts thee, and hales thee to the Judg. Thou could'ſt formerly live without God, and be as ſtill as the dead body in the grave, and the burning brand in the fire: but now as a bone out of joynt, thou art reſtleſs till in communion with him: I remembred God, and was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 3.</p>
                     <pb n="389" facs="tcp:132285:212"/>
                     <p>Thou wert gone out of the way; yea an enemie to the way of life, turn'd aſide to the flock of his companions, and did'ſt turn again, and rend thoſe that were of them. But now thou art folded with the flocks of Chriſt, and feedeſt beſides the Shepherds Tents, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 8. Thy foot hath held his ſteps, and thou eſteemeſt the word of his mouth more than thy neceſſary food, <hi>Job</hi> 23. 11, 12.</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But may not an hypocrite go ſo far, and all this be no more than a change from darkneſs to conſcience-light, and from ſin to common grace.</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Common light cannot ſee a deſirableneſs in Chriſt for himſelf, nor bring the ſoul to count all things droſs and dung to win him, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the excellency of the knowledg of Chriſt as thy Lord; but ſaving light ſees one Chriſt worth ten thouſand Worlds, and quits all to take him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                     <p>Common light ſees no evil in ſin; but guilt, and torment, loſs of comfort, and ſenſe of puniſhment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13. but true grace, when in exerciſe, loaths ſin when it pretends love; and flies from ſin when it makes largeſt proffers; and fears ſin when it ſees no danger, when there is no breach on preſent comfort feeled, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of future miſery feared, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. The gracious ſoul, like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when tempted with flattery, ſecur'd with ſecreſie, purſued with reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs importunity to wickedneſs, yet cannot cloſe with it, and ſin againſt God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 9.</p>
                     <p>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:132285:213"/> light can dwell with works of darkneſs, and conſiſt with an unſanctified heart and life, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2. Common light and luſt never fall out but when it awakens conſcience, or weakens intereſts: but ſaving grace cannot bear that which is evil, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. or ever be brought to a treaty with ſin, in order to an agreement, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. but, with <hi>Sarah,</hi> can never be at reſt till the bond-woman and her ſon be turn'd out of door, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 10. Common grace may be offended at ſin, but never hates ſin; there is no contrariety founded in their nature or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but what may upon terms be made up, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 12. And if it ſeems to have an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt ſin, yet 'tis not againſt every ſin, and at all times, nor irreconcilable at any time: but ſaving grace hates the very being of ſin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. And as the Tyger flies at the very picture of a man, ſo doth Grace abhor the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil: 'Tis univerſal againſt the whole ſpecies, and every kind of ſin; an enmity founded in the nature of grace, and therefore irreconcilable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 22. and derived from the riches of grace, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 97. 10. and greatneſs of redemption-love: It cannot be reconciled to ſin, becauſe ſin cannot be reconciled to grace, or admit of any love to, or enjoyment of God; but ſtill interrupts the ſoul's tranquillity, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and pleaſure in God, his chiefeſt and only good.</p>
                     <p>Again, Common light can live without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial acquaintance with God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13. [afar of,] if it can have peace, becauſe its Countrey is nouriſhed by the King's Countrey, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 20.
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:132285:213"/> and its welfare depends upon divine pleaſure, 'tis all it looks for: but ſaving grace gets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the veil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. approaches the mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat, where it converſes with God. To be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his name will not content grace; no, nor to eat his bread, and wear his rayment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it enjoys his bed alſo: it longs for intimate communion with God, <hi>Pſal. 101. 2. O, when wilt thou come unto me?</hi> It loves the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, cloſet, and ſecret corners with him; never thinking it ſelf near enough to, or long enough with him.</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But change from nature to grace, is not growth in grace: though I may have received the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rain, and reaped the firſt fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; yet I fear I have not the latter rain, and after-fruits of grace: waterings and dreſſings do not make me fruitful, or feedings make me grow: and that's the caſe you inſiſt on.</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. There may be fruit, though not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing; and growth, though unſeen: Chriſt hath under-ground-fruit, which may not ſpring up to thy own view, or others, <hi>Pſ. 88. 5. [Free among the dead,</hi>] as berries hid among the leaves, which cannot be ſeen till winter-ſtorms or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king times come: thou mayeſt thrive more inwardly than outwardly, and be like the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the Temple, wide within, and narrow without; you may grow more in the truth and parts of grace, though leſs in the fruits of grace for a ſeaſon; thy ſincerity may be more, though thy ſhews be leſs; you may grow more down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:132285:214"/> in humility, ſelf-abaſement, ſorrow for ſin, though not upward in joys and bloſſoms of comfort; thou mayeſt grow more out of thy ſelf, and into Chriſt, as the root of all thy grace, and foundation of thy foul-reſt, though not into ſenſible frames and workings of grace. Art thou more ſenſible of thy own nothingneſs? thy heart-deceitfulneſs? ſelf-inſufficiency? in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſorders? ſoul-wants? ſinfulneſs? hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie? barrenneſs? then thou profiteſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. Art thou more jealous of thy heart every day, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27? more weary of thy ſelf? and longing after Chriſt? having a higher valuation of his excellency, and greater breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after his quickning ſpirit, and delighting preſence, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8? this is profiting.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It may be thy concluſion ſprings from thy impatiency; thou mayeſt be for haſty fruit, not allowing time for its growth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. The Husbandman waits for the precious fruits of the earth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 7. before he can enjoy them, or eſtimate their worth: Thy hopes, labours and profit may be buried under the clods for a while: <hi>We cannot ſow and reap</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>in a day:</hi> The more excellent and durable the fruit is, the longer is it before it comes to maturity: rare ripe fruits are ſoon rotten: hypocrites bloſſom a pace, and caſt their leaves as faſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. Though 'tis matter of ſhame, that thoſe trees which have leſs earth, and leaſt nouriſhment, ſhould grow faſteſt; yet the reaſon is, they take up no time in getting root, and growing downward; and hence all their growth is outward.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:132285:214"/> Thirdly, It may be 'tis a winter-time with thy ſoul; the Sun of Righteouſneſs is withdrawn from thee, and thy lightſom daies are gone, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 11, 12. The Comforter that ſhould have relieved thy ſoul, is far from thee, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 16. It may be thou haſt ſinn'd away his warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſence, and loſt thy firſt ſpring; hence 'tis the flowers do not appear: Yet here's thy comfort, though thy winter be not a time of fruit, yet God will make it to thee a time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fruitfulneſs.</p>

                     <p>2. You that have any good Trading for Heaven, be exhorted to enlarge your Trade; drive a greater Trade of godlineſs every day, as men that proſper in the world do; they build larger barns, fairer houſes, greater ſhops, get more goods, buy more land, and widen the bounds of their intereſts: So ſhould you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, if God bleſs your heavenly ſubſtance, and proſper your ſouls; if the gain of godlineſs come in, lay it out to greaten godlineſs, as biting Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers do, take uſe upon uſe; convert your get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings into your Trade; put your incomes into bank, and your bleſſings into ſtock, trading on them. Think</p>
                     <p>Firſt, On the ſmalneſs of thy firſt ſtock, and thy low eſtate at thy ſetting up, A <hi>Syrian</hi> ready to periſh, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 5. thy grace was ſmall, a grain of muſtard ſeed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 31. thy capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is weak, a new-born babe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3.

                     <p>Secondly, Conſider what a poor Trade moſt men drive for Heaven this day; few that ſeek the things that are Chriſt's, and make Religion their buſineſs. All men ſeek their own things; the multitude of Profeſſours, as well as others, wonder after this beaſt the world: We may ſay of Religion, as the Prophet did of <hi>Sion: This is godlineſs which no man ſeeketh after, Jer.</hi> 30. 17. Few <hi>Iſraelites, in whom there is no guile;</hi> few <hi>Noahs, perfect in their generation, walking with God;</hi> few <hi>Calebs, who fulfill after God.</hi> Moſt mens Religion lies in notion, profeſſion, talkings, frames, priviledges, going to Meetings, getting into Churches; but few make conſcience of their words and waies, their promiſes and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; few ſecond-table men and women, that cauſe their light to ſhine before men; and as <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, walking in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and ordinances of God blameleſs, Luke 1. 6. doing juſtly, ſhewing mercy, and walking humbly with their God, Mich. 6. 8. viſiting the fatherleſs and widow in their affliction, and keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unſpotted from the world, Jam.</hi> 1. 27. And ſhould not this provoke thy zeal for the Lord of Hoſts, to ſee the Altars of Religion down, and ſo few friends of godlineſs left, and ſtir up thy holy ambition to excel and do more for God than others? It would argue a brave ſpirit, and be a worthy attempt to offer a lift at fal'n godlineſs, with thy <hi>life</hi> as well as <hi>lip,</hi> and by the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:132285:215"/> raiſed ſplendour of thy holy converſation, as a City on a hill, to provoke others to an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaying, <hi>Come up hither.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Think alſo what an excellent Trade the Saints and Angels in Heaven drive, who have their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in hand, and dwell in the City of the great King, who are alwaies receiving and rendering, driving a whole Trade for God, above all hazards and interruptions: They alway behold their Father's face, and ſerve him day and night in his Temple, with palms in their hands, with ſongs in their mouths, and their Crowns at his feet, and how far you are beneath theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Merchants. Think what a breadth you have yet to fill up in godlineſs, and what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances you muſt make in holineſs, before you can get up to their pitch, and have a place amongſt them that ſtand by, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. 7. and is it not time yet to build the houſe of God? <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 2. and that you haſten to your work, and raiſe higher ſtories for God every day, preſſing after greater meaſures of grace, till you come to the fulneſs of the ſtature of Chriſt, and thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of glorified Saints and Angels?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, When will you be fit for a return into your own Countrey, and a comfortable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your Stewardſhip, if you be ſo ſlothful and contracted in your Heavenly Trade? When will your ſhips be loaden, and your ſacks full for a departure hence, if you trade at ſuch a rare, and attend your ſoul-thrivings no better? your Treaſure is deep, and calls for more digging; your Crown is afar off, and requires faſter run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; your Reward is large, greater enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:132285:216"/> of labours are needful to meeten you for it. O think how far glory is above all your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of grace and duty; and what need you have to preſs after more enlargedneſs in your ſouls, and ſuitableneſs for your eſtate above.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The greater Trade you drive for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the leſs trouble; 'tis not ſo in earthly Trades; there the more work, the more wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs; but Religion carries refreſhment in its work. <hi>John 4. 34. My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work. Prov. 3. 17. Her waies are waies of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi> O the ſweetneſs and delicate pleaſure which vigorous purſuits of holineſs afford! <hi>Cant. 2. 3. I ſate under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte.</hi> If perſons intermeddle not with the joy of godlineſs, 'tis becauſe they neglect the work of it; they eat not the kernel, becauſe they break not the ſhell; Chriſt's myrrh is to be gathered, and his honey eaten with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-comb, which muſt be ſqueezed out ere ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Cant. 5. 1. Rabbi Solomon</hi> takes the comb <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, for a Cane, <note n="n" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Pro canna in qua ſit mel quod exugatur abjecta can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> Mercer.</note> out of which the honey is ſucked, or the ſugar boyled out. They that will eat Chriſt's pleaſant bread, muſt work hard for it; his idlers have none of his dainties; the greater the labour, the ſweeter is the reſt. The Lord's way is not tireſom, unleſs to fleſh and blood: the more you run in it, the leſs weary. <hi>Iſa. 40. 31. They ſhall run, but not be weary, walk, but not faint:</hi> And though they ſhould be weary in
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:132285:216"/> well doing, through their carnal ſloth, yet they are not weary of it.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The greater Trade, the richer; 'tis not alwaies ſo in worldy employments; men may labour in vain, and ſit down in ſorrow, but godlineſs is profitable for all things, <hi>Iſa. 55. 2. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 8. And the Heavenly Trade brings in the true Treaſure, as I have already ſhewn; and the more employment, the more profit.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, The larger Trade you drive for Heaven, the more you have of that honour that comes down from Heaven, <hi>Rom. 2. 10. Glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good.</hi> The greater Trade, the greater riches, and the greater riches, the greater reputation: <hi>The rich hath many friends, Prov.</hi> 14. 20. The greater Trade you drive for Heaven, the greater regard you have from God; the more of his preſence is with you, his delight in you, and bleſſing upon you; the Spouſes growth and fruitfulneſs, was much taking upon the heart of Chriſt. <hi>How fair and how pleaſant art thou O Love for delights! Cant. 7. 6, 7. This thy ſtature is like to a Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and thy breaſts to cluſters of grapes.</hi> The Palm-tree is an emblem of growth and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; the more it is oppreſt, the more it grows, and no tree more fruitful; 'tis called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:132285:217"/> that this Palm-tree yields, <note n="o" place="bottom">
                           <hi>In fructuum jam maturorum locum alii fructus eodem in loco &amp; eadem parte ſtatim ſuccedunt.</hi> Plin.</note> and hence the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> make it a ſymbole of the ſolar year, which conſiſts of three hundred ſixty five daies: and its fruit is wonderfully reſtorative and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, repairing the decayed ſtrength, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical moiſture of man's body, <hi>Alſted. Theol. Nat.</hi> and therefore a fit metaphor to expreſs the Church's fruitfulneſs, in which the Lord Jeſus takes ſuch great delight; he gets up early to the Vineyard, to ſee if the Vine flouriſh, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the tender grape appear, and the Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate bud forth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. 12. So delightful is the view of a flouriſhing people unto Chriſt: The more you thrive in grace, the more will you have of Chriſt's company; and that's honourable.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, The greater Trade you drive for Heaven, the more uſeful you are while on Earth; the larger capacities you have to do good to others, and to ſerve your generation, which is a bleſſed thing. <hi>'Tis more bleſſed to give than to receive, Acts 20. 35. 1 Tim. 6. 17, 18. Charge them that are rich in this world, that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate.</hi> The richer you are in grace, the more able you are to do good, and not only able, but the more willing alſo. The reaſon Chriſtians have no more heart to do good, and to communicate, is their ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverty; they are not rich in grace, they have but little ſpiritual Treaſure, little grace to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; their hands are ſhut, becauſe their hearts are empty; but the more divine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:132285:217"/> you have, the more ready will you be to do good, and to lay out both your outward and inward riches. O how uſeful may rich men be in the places where they live, if God give them hearts to do it! and how helpful may ſuch be in this day of ſoul-wants, who are encreaſed with ſpiritual goods? there are many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed ſouls this day who are ready to periſh for want of light, peace and comfort; perplexed with doubts, darkneſs, and diſtreſſing fears, and have none to help them. O how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, in ſuch a day of ſoul-exigences, would it be to have ſome rich neighbours among them, ſome proſperous <hi>Jobs! Who with-hold not the poor from their deſire, nor cauſe the eyes of the Widow to fail,</hi> Job 31. 16, 17, 19. <hi>Who would draw forth their ſoul to the hungry, and ſatisfy the afflicted ſoul,</hi> Iſa. 58. 10. <hi>Who could not eat their morſel alone, or ſee the poor to periſh for want of clothing: To be eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame,</hi> Job 29. 15. <hi>To ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary, and to comfort others with the ſame comforts they have received of God.</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, make haſte to be rich in grace, that ye may be rich in good works; that ye may caſt in much into the Lord's treaſury, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 41. and out of your abundance caſt into the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 4. Then ſhould the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the poor, that was ready to periſh, come upon you, <hi>Job.</hi> 29. 13. and the fruit of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing be your ſavoury meat, on which the Lord would daily feed you.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, The greater Trade you drive for Heaven now, the greater will your eſtate in
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:132285:218"/> Heaven be hereafter: 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. Henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs; which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me at that day; and not to me only, but to all that love his appearing.</hi> To me, who have run my race, finiſh'd my courſe, and kept the faith: To me, who have wrought hard in the Vineyard, and traded diligently for Heaven in the World: For me, yea for all ſuch as enlarge their heavenly Trade, <hi>is laid up,</hi>

                     <p>There are four ſpecial ſeaſons when gracious ſouls will have need of all their ſtore to relieve them.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Times of Temptation are ſpending times, and call for great ſuccours to be laid in againſt ſuch ſeaſons. Firſt, Becauſe ſuch times are certain to Believers, they will come. <hi>Pſal. 11. 5. The Lord tryeth the righteous:</hi> There's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a gracious ſoul, but ſome time or other the Lord trieth it, either immediately by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or mediately by afflictions or temptations from men or devils. The Apoſtle tells us, every
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:132285:220"/> man is tempted. <hi>James 1. 14. But every man is tempted when he is drawn aſide of his own luſt and enticed. The beſt of men</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>are tempted, and that when they are at the beſt. [Capell of Temptation.] Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, <hi>Gen. 3. 6. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> after God had twice appeared to him, 1 <hi>King. 11. 9. Job</hi> after the evidences of his uprightneſs before God, and religious duties, <hi>Job 1. 1, 5. Peter</hi> after he had made a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, and entered into covenant never to be offended at him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 33. Yea Chriſt himſelf after his Baptiſm, and the Spirit's reſting on him as a Dove, and the Father's owning of him by an audible voice from Heaven, <hi>Matth. 3. 17. chap. 4. 1. He</hi> (ſaith the former Author) <hi>that thinks he is ſo good that he ought not to be tempted, and ſo ſtrong, that he need not fear to be tempted, hath need of a temptation, that by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in himſelf, he might prove what he ought to have found in the Word; that of our ſelves we have no ſtrength.</hi> Capell.</p>
                     <p>Four things make temptations unavoidable to gracious ſouls:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 <hi>God's good Pleaſure.</hi>

                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Firſt, 'Tis God's good Pleaſure to have them tryed: <hi>The fire ſhall try every man's work of what ſort it is, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 13. whether it will bear the fire or no; hereby the excellency of his work, the greatneſs of his power appears, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during graces of the Saints, and their ſtanding after all. By this the Lord will confute the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:132285:220"/> ſlanders of men and devils, who are ſtill charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his people with hypocriſie, and falling away when tryal comes; <hi>Doth Job fear God for naught? Job 1. 9. Put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face, Job</hi> 2. 5. This is the uſual calumny of the Saints enemies; to confute which, and prove them lyars, doth the Lord ſuffer his people to be tempted. 'Tis his will and purpoſe that all his people ſhould be tryed; and therefore 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Such is Satan's Rage, he cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies keep his fingers from them; if he lets them alone, 'tis but for a ſeaſon. <hi>Luke 4. 13. When the Devil had ended all the temptations, he departed from him for a ſeaſon.</hi> Is Satan buſie? then his work is not done; haſt thou any reſt? 'tis becauſe his tempting-time is not come; he is a roaring Lion, and cannot reſt from ſeeking to devour, though he forbears attempting to devour for a ſeaſon, when it makes to his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantage: Never expect freedom from temptation, till Satan's chain be ſhortened, or thy remove without his reach obtained, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Saints corruptions expoſe them to temptations; <hi>Where the carkaſs is, there the Eagles reſort, Mat.</hi> 24. 28. While the Saints have gall'd backs they can expect no freedom from flies. If <hi>Sampſon</hi> be bound, the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> will be upon him. <hi>The cauſe of thoſe ſins is in us where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the occaſion is from Satan,</hi> Capell. Till the fire of Hell be out in the Saints, the Devil will not lay down his bellows; where there is no
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:132285:221"/> ſin, there is no matter for temptation to work on; as where there is no morbid matter, there contagion cannot ſo eaſily faſten, corruption keeps open the door for Satan; never look for ſilence from Satan, till you find ceſſation from ſin.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The profit and good of gracious ſouls do neceſſitate it: By this means they come to ſee their own vileneſs; were it not for temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they could not ſee the greatneſs of their corruption: <hi>David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Peter,</hi> did not think their hearts were ſo abominable, till left to temptation, which ſtirs the mud, and brings up the bottom to the top; and this helps to abaſe them, and make them more vile in their own eyes. By this alſo they ſee their own weakneſs, and their need of Chriſt; and are more effectually brought out of themſelves to the Lord Jeſus for ſuccour and victory. And by temptations from Satan they come to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his devices, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. and more skill'd in his wiles and ſtratagems (no ſmall advantage to one that is in a ſtate of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare with him.) This way alſo doth the Lord winnow his Saints, and by theſe high winds fan and cleanſe them. <hi>Luke 22. 31. Satan hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat;</hi> and brings them to more conformity to their head, and to greater eſtabliſhment in grace, which are glorious advantages to Believers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the New Covenant, and this way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd, which makes temptations neceſſary to Wiſdom's Merchants, and renders it their great concern to lay in proviſion againſt them.</p>
                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:132285:221"/>
                     <p>Secondly, As temptations are certain, and will come; ſo they are ſhaking when they come; they are part of that rain, flood and wind which did beat vehemently on the ſandy building, that it fell, <hi>Mat. 7. 27. Luke</hi> 6. 49. Temptations are part of the Devil's Artillery, his fiery darts and cruel buffettings which none can bear without the whole Armour of God upon him, and then too; all they can do is but to ſtand, <hi>Epheſ. 6. v.</hi> 13, 16. They are ſo potent and prevailing, as that none but ſuch as are in Chriſt can ſtand their ground under them. <hi>And in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation fall away, Luke</hi> 8. 13. Receive the Word with joy, ſeem to love God, and delight in his waies for a ſeaſon, till temptations come to the purpoſe, and then fall away. There are ſome temptations are more eaſie to be born, but when Satan ſets on a ſoul with all his might, there's no ſtanding without divine ſuccour, and the Lord's opening a way to eſcape. Temptation is reckoned amongſt the ſoreſt afflictions that the Saints do undergo, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 13. Heb. 2. 18. Heb, 11. 37. They were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, they were tempted, they were ſlain with the ſword.</hi> No ſuffering like temptations, for they draw the ſoul to ſin, which is more cruel than death to a ſoul that loves Chriſt. O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, what need have you then to be laying in for an hour of temptation, ſeeing it will ſurely come, and ſeeing it will be ſo terrible when it comes!</p>
                     <p>Get your ſelves well furniſh'd with wiſdom, that you may know Satan's devices, that you may be able to diſtinguiſh between temptation
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:132285:222"/> and corruption, and able to anſwer the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſubtle reaſonings of Satan; you muſt have experience alſo to encourage your hope, and ſtrengthen your patience, that inſtances of former relief in the like caſes may lift up your head, and ſtrengthen your expectations in new Tryals alſo. You muſt lay in ſtore of faith to guard your hearts, and ſhield your heads from the fiery darts of Satan; you muſt get your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity cleared, and the uprightneſs of your heart and way evidenced; that's of great uſe alſo to bear up your Spirit under all his charges againſt you. Make much of every breathing of his Spirit in you, and take care you quench not any of his motions: <hi>God</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>doth often leave us to own Satan's ſuggeſtions for our own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not own God in his holy motions and breathings.</hi> And have good evidences of your intereſt in Chriſt, and aſſurance of his love to you, and aſſured help in the time of need; taking ſpecial care to have corruptions weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a growing mortification in your ſouls; that ſo when Satan comes he may find nothing in you to faſten his temptations on: This calls for your provident care, to ſtore your ſouls againſt times of Tryal.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Times of deſertion are ſpending<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, which will need a full ſtock, when the Lord doth hide his face, and withdraw the ſenſe of his love, and influence of his quickening pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: This the Lord may do, and hath done; he hath left the dearly beloved of his ſoul; gone from his habitation; compaſſ himſelf about with a cloud; left his children in darkneſs as thoſe
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:132285:222"/> that have been long dead. <hi>'Tis juſt with God</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Cooper) to deny us the comfort of our graces, when we deny him the glory of them. Iſa. 45. 15. Verily thou art a God that hideſt thy ſelf, O God of Iſrael the Saviour. Job 23. 8, 9. Behold I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but cannot perceive him, on the left hand where he doth work, but I cannot behold him; he hideth himſelf on the right hand that I cannot ſee him. Iſa. 49. 14. But Zion ſaid, The Lord hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, my God hath forgotten me.</hi> This was one of the greateſt ſufferings on Chriſt, his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his Father's forſaking him. <hi>O God my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Mat.</hi> 27. 46. Here was a total and final deſertion that our Lord Jeſus came under as to his ſenſe, and the effects of it; he ſaw nothing of the comforts of the Divine preſence, to the laſt breath of life, but died in this darkneſs. <hi>Verſe 50. Jeſus when he had cryed again with a loud voice</hi> (that is, as he had done, <hi>verſe 46.) he gave up the Ghoſt;</hi> and had no comfort to the laſt minute of life: And if God hath done ſo to the green tree, how much more may he to the dry? if he forſake his natural and onely beloved Son, he may ſurely hide himſelf from his Adopted Sons, even to their dying hour: And this is a condition full of conſternation and terrour: The <hi>poena damni,</hi> the loſs of God, and all good, is thought to be a far greater puniſhment to the damned, than all the puniſhment of ſenſe and torment. O the dreadful apprehenſions that good ſouls have had about God's forſaking them! 'Tis a Hell on Earth, and the beginning of the ſecond death,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:132285:223"/> to be under a real ſenſe of God's removal from the ſoul. O the amazing dread, and conſuming rerrour, that <hi>Job, Aſaph, Heman,</hi> and others were fill'd with, by ſuch apprehenſions of God's withdrawment from them, and his wrath lying hard upon them! Soul, though now it be a time of light with thee, the Candle of the Lord ſhines upon thee; thou walkeſt in the light of his countenance, lyeſt in his boſom, and art dandled on his knee; yet may the days of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be many, and thy ſoul lie in the ſhadow of death, and under real apprehenſions of the Lord's departure from thee, and diſpleaſure againſt thee, and then thou wilt find need of all the cordials, light and hope imaginable. O lay in ſure and unqueſtionable ſatisfaction about this great caſe; that God is really and inſeparably yours; and under all your clouds, fears and guilt, think well of God. <hi>'Tis hard</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>to think ill of our ſelves, and well of God at the ſame time.</hi> Store your ſelves with promiſes and experiences, with faith, hope, patience, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grace that may bear you up in ſuch a Tryal, and cordial your fainting heart under ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous deliquiums. <hi>If God ſhould damne me</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>I have two arms, the one of faith, and the other of love, with which I would embrace him, and carry him with me, and his preſence would make Hell it ſelf a Heaven to me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Times of ſore affliction, and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing calamities, are ſpending-times, and will try your ſtore of grace, and ſtrength to bear it, and to get through it; and ſuch you may live to ſee: The Croſs is the uſual way to the Crown,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:132285:223"/> and affliction the lot of them that will live god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>And we muſt through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Act. 14. 22. <hi>The fining-pot is for ſilver, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace for gold,</hi> Prov. 17. 3. And the fan for the wheat; the condition of Believers in this world cannot long bear proſperity without loſs to their ſpiritual part. Chriſtians under ſettled comforts in this world, are like ſtanding pools, which ſoon gather mud; and as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Moab,</hi> ſo 'tis with the people of God. <hi>Jer. 48. 11. Moab hath been at eaſe from his youth, and he hath ſettled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from veſſel to veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, neither hath he gone into captivity, therefore his taſte remained in him, and his ſcent is not changed. The ſweeteſt nights that ever</hi> Jacob <hi>ſpent were in the field; ſo with</hi> Peter <hi>in priſon; and</hi> David <hi>had thoſe large affections to riſe at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and God's Word was ſweet to him when his trouble was bitter,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>Harris.</hi> But by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions the Lord refines his people from their droſs. <hi>Though the wiſdom of the world</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Bradford) think of the croſs according to ſenſe, and therefore flieth from it as from a moſt great ignominy and ſhame; yet God's ſcholars have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think otherwiſe of the Croſs, as the frame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe wherein God frameth his children, like to his Son Chriſt: the furnace that fineth God's gold, the high way to Heaven, the ſuit and livery of God's ſervants, the earneſt and beginning of all conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and glory. Acts &amp; Mon. 3. Vol. page</hi> 322. If you will be Chriſt's Diſciple, you muſt expect tribulation; <hi>If need be you are in heavineſs for a ſeaſon.</hi> God's fire is in <hi>Sion,</hi> and his furnace in

That which we may clearly gather hence is, that thoſe laſt times will be times of ſore cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, both perſonal and publick, to Nations, and to the Church of God; and what a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:132285:224"/> of thoſe amazing troubles may fall upon the people of this age, we know not: this is certain, God ſeems to give his call from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as well as out of his Sanctuary, to prepare to meet with him, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 12. to gird up the loins of our mind, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 15. to keep our garments on; to watch, leſt he come as a thief, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 35, 36. to have our veſſels ſtor'd with Oil, and our lamps burning; and to reckon on midnight ſitting up, and be as men that look for the coming of their Lord: <hi>Matth. 25. 6. To watch and pray always, that we may be counted worthy to eſcape the things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of man,</hi> Luke 21. 36.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The time of Death is a ſpending time, and calls for great proviſions for that long journey; and great change the Soul is then paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into. Death is the King of Terrors: O how amazing is the ſight of it to a natural eye, and an awakened conſcience! the work that death comes to do is frightful work to fleſh and blood; to pluck a ſoul out of its ancient dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, to take it from all its acquaintance, friends, relations, and earthly All, from the comforts of the whole World, never to ſee or enjoy them more, as they have done; nay, to pull down this earthly tabernacle, not to leave a ſtone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtone, but quite to demoliſh it to the ground, is a great change: to lay a writ on the ſoul's back, and in a moment to bring it to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from all its acquaintance, friends, and deareſt relations, to the viſion of an infinite ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, there to receive its eternal doom, and to enter into a new eſtate, out of which he ſhall
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:132285:225"/> never depart, either of bleſſedneſs or miſery. To take the ſoul off from all the means of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and poſſibility of change out of that eſtate into which, by death he enters; that if the ſoul ſhould die in his ſins, there's no future repentance, or any thing can be done to mend his ill condition: this will be terrible to a guilty conſcience, ſenſible of many ſins unrepented of, many duties neglected, much time loſt, great hypocriſies uncur'd, many fears unremoved, and doubts unanſwered. Now for ſuch a ſoul, in a moment, to come to judgment, and to have no time allowed him to ſet things in order for ſo great a compearance, and to ſtate his account for that final Audit, is an amazing providence. The time of death is alſo a time of the greateſt light, when the ſoul's eye ſhall be opened to ſee things as they are, no more in a glaſs, but face to face; then the ſoul that hath been dark all its days, ſhall ſee clearly things it never knew. As 'tis ſaid of the Mole, that it is blind all its time, till it comes to die, and then it ſees: So they that would not ſee, ſhall then ſee, and be aſhamed; then ſhall ſouls ſee things as they are, and find that to be evil which they thought good, and that to be good which they thought to be evil. Death is the greateſt informer, and makes the largeſt diſcovery of things that ever was; it brings to light the hidden things of darkneſs, ſins the world never knew, and ſins it may be the ſoul it ſelf never ſaw, or thought it ſelf guilty of: then will the leaſt flaw, error, unſoundneſs, neglect, failing, be fully ſeen; then the things that now ſeem to be ſmall, will then
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:132285:225"/> appear to be great; and thoſe things that were taken for mountains, will be leſs than one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle grain of duſt.</p>
                     <p>Death is a time alſo when conſcience hath its quickeſt ſenſes, and livelieſt acts, when it ſees, hears, feels, fears, all things as they are, and without any other witneſs, becomes both Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer and Judge: then <hi>Judas</hi> needed no Accuſer to charge him, or Judge to condemn him, but his own conſcience; nor Executioner to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him, but his own hand. <hi>What's the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, man,</hi> (ſaid Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> to a Malefactor, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the ladder, and his countenance ſhewing the inward terrors of his ſoul,) <hi>art thou afraid to die? O, no Sir, ſaid he, but of a worſe matter.</hi> So another upon her death-bed, and under a terrible ſight of her wicked life, when one that was by offered ſomething to comfort her againſt the fear of death, replied, <hi>Were it but to die, it were nothing: A world</hi> (ſaid another, upon the border of eternity, and under conſcience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affrightings) <hi>for one inch of time! O give me one inch of time!</hi> Luther <hi>ſpeaks of an</hi> Eremite <hi>who, a little before his death, ſtood very ſad, never ſtirring out of his place for three days, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his eyes fixt towards Heaven; and being ask'd the reaſon of this poſture, anſwered, he was afraid to die: His Scholars began to comfort him, telling him he need not to fear death, who had been ſo holy in his life; but he replies, 'tis true, I have lived well, and been obedient, but God's judgments are otherwiſe than Man's judgment,</hi> Tom. 4. fol. 50.</p>

                     <p>The time of death is a time of great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation alſo; then Satan uſually brings forth his chiefeſt ſtrength to weaken the ſoul's faith; 'tis his laſt onſet, and that is the hotteſt; as men that ſtorm a Garriſon, in their laſt aſſault they uſually put forth their utmoſt ſtrength: <hi>Then he oppoſeth us with moſt armed force. In this laſt aſſault,</hi>

                     <p>Beſides, you receive not your mercies as Owners, but as Stewards, to keep and uſe them for him, and according to his inſtruction, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 10. As every one hath received the gift</hi> (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of grace, or gifts of grace, inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gifts, ſpiritual or temporal, 'tis all one if he have received it) <hi>ſo let him adminiſter the ſame, as good Stewards of the manifold grace of life.</hi> Your intereſts are God's gifts; your abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, his Bounty and truſt to be beſtowed to his uſe and pleaſure, for which you muſt give an account.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, 'Tis pleaſing work to lay out for God: <hi>Paul</hi> counted not his life dear to lay out for Chriſt, <hi>Acts 20. 24. Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> rejoyced that they were counted worthy to part with their name, and to undergo reproach for Chriſt, <hi>Acts. 5. 41. Nazianzen was glad that he had ſomething of value, to wit, his</hi> Athenian <hi>learning to part with for Chriſt. The Mother of</hi> William Hunter <hi>the Martyr rejoyced, that ever ſhe was ſo happy as to bear ſuch a child as could find in his heart to loſe his life for Chriſt's Name ſake, Acts and Mon. p.</hi> 13. 96. Nothing ſeems burdenſom to do or part with for Chriſt, to a ſoul that loves him: How willingly did <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſtrip himſelf of the Robe that was upon him, and gave it to <hi>David,</hi> and his garments even to his ſword, and to his bow, and to his girdle, becauſe
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:132285:228"/> he loved him; much more pleaſing will it be to a ſoul loving Chriſt, to part with his All for Chriſt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 4.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, 'Tis honourable work alſo to lay out for God; <hi>He that gives to the poor lendeth to the Lord, Prov.</hi> 19. 17. And is not this honourable to make God a debtor, and to get him who is over all bleſſed for ever, to become bound to his creature: O what honour is this, that the Giver of All ſhould ſeem to be beholding to his creatures, who have their All from him! Have you any thing you can part with for Chriſt? think what honour 'tis that God entruſts you with the beſtowing of ſuch gifts for him; the Lord might have made you beggars, not givers; who hath made you to differ? why is grace, gifts, ſtrength, eſtate, time, put into thy hand, and not into others? it ſhews a good opinion God hath of thy faithfulneſs, and ſo beſpeaks honour: O let not God have cauſe to revoke this eſtimation!</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, 'Tis profitable work: The more you lay out for God, the more you get for your ſelves; there's no ſuch way to gather, as to ſcatter for God; your improvements of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to God's end, are but as ſowing of ſeed, which will come in again with greater encreaſe, 2 <hi>Cor. 9. 6. He that ſoweth ſparingly, ſhall reap ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, and he that ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully.</hi> Laying out for God is Trading ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, not liable to hazards, as earthly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings are, but under a promiſe of ſure and great returns, as hath been proved, and that is profit. Laying out for God, is lending to God
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:132285:228"/> upon intereſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 29. where both prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and intereſt are ſure. <hi>Prov. 19. 17. He that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth to the Lord, and that which he hath given, will he pay him again.</hi> The Lord takes it as done to himſelf, and will repay with large uſe; <note n="x" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Tibi a Domino etiam cum ampliſſimo faenore redden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi> Mercer.</note> he lends to the Lord upon bond for uſe, as the Hebrew imports, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and he will ſurely repay it. God is bound for it, and therefore the debt is ſure. Tis a great miſtake in men, and that which ſtarves their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſiveneſs for God, to think the more they give, the leſs they have; whereas laying out for God brings in principal and uſe; it ſanctifies what is left, and brings it under a promiſe of encreaſe. As the pouring out of the Widows Oil fill'd her veſſels; the more ſhe poured out, the more ſhe had, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 5, 6. And as the Widow of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rephath,</hi> by giving firſt to the Prophet, ſecur'd her own proviſion in a time of famine. 1 <hi>Kings 17. 13, 14. For thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, the barrel of meal ſhall not waſte, neither ſhall the cruſe of Oil fail, until the day that the Lord ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rain upon the earth. Mal. 3. 10. Bring ye all the tithes into the ſtore-houſe, that there may be meat in my houſe, and prove me now herewith, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, if I will not open you the windows of Heaven, and pour you out a bleſſing that there ſhall not be room enough to receive it.</hi> 'Tis mens niggardlineſs to God, and cloſe-handedneſs to the poor, and pious uſes, is one reaſon doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the waſts and blaſtings on their outward intereſts this day. <hi>Prov. 11. 28. The liberal ſoul
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:132285:229"/> ſhall be made fat, and he that watereth ſhall be watered alſo himſelf. Cartwright</hi> and <hi>Baine</hi> think this is meant of ſpiritual gifts, as the former verſe is of external good things. But as <hi>Mercer</hi> well obſerves, the ſentence is general, and takes in any ſupplies that are given to ſuch as are needy <note n="y" place="bottom">

Honour the Lord with thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſo ſhall thy barns be filled with plenty.</hi> Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of promiſes might be heaped up, which give in a joynt-teſtimony to this truth; as <hi>Mat. 25. 29. Eccleſ. 11. 1. Prov. 28. 27. Prov. 22. 9. Iſa.</hi> 58. 7, 8, 10, 11. with many others, and are abundant ſecurity for the bleſſing to ſuch as lay out for God.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, this is a proof of your love to God, 2 <hi>Cor. 8. 24. Wherefore ſhew ye to them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Churches the proof of your love,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. v. 17. <hi>Whoſo hath this worlds goods, and ſeeth his Brother hath need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> 1 John 4. 20. <hi>For he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> By true charity to your poor Brethren you evidence your love to God; that ſecures all your true and needed mercies.</p>
                     <pb n="423" facs="tcp:132285:229"/>
                     <p>Fifthly, This alſo is pleaſing to God, <hi>Phil. 4. v. 18. Having received of Epaphroditus the things which were ſent from you, an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable, well-pleaſing to God,</hi> Heb. 13. 16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 4. and that is ſurely proſperous.</p>
                     <p>Then Chriſtians, if God hath firſt given unto you; if you love him; if you would pleaſe him; if you would proſper in ſoul, body and eſtate, lay out for God: If you have freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, freely give; whatever God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted you with, expend it for him.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Lay out your time for God: Among the many waſts of mercies ſouls are guilty of, this is not the leaſt; <hi>waſte of precious time:</hi> Though there is no creature-bleſſing of greater worth than time, in which a foundation is laid, of all thoſe mercies that are eternal. Time is a talent, a treaſure; not onely a mercy, but that without which there can be no mercy: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider for your improvement of Time,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Your Time is not yours, but God's, made by him, and for him. <hi>Pſal. 76. 17. The day is thin, and the night is thine; thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the Light and the Sun.</hi> Time is that ſpace between two Eternities, limited by divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to divine uſe. <hi>Job 14. 5. Seeing his daies are determined, the number of his months are with thee; thou haſt appointed his bounds that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs.</hi> And if Time be the Lord's, then 'tis fit it ſhould be uſed for God. <hi>Give unto God the things that are God's.</hi> When thou ſinneſt or trifieſt away this Time, think on this; <hi>now I rob God, and ſpend another's goods.</hi> You that hate robbery of men, be not thieves to God and your own
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:132285:230"/> ſouls: Time is God's, not thine own.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Think how much you have loſt of paſt Time, and this ſhould make you choice of preſent Time. <hi>Pſal. 90. 9. We ſpend our years as a tale that is told;</hi> which vaniſheth into the Air and is ſoon gone. <hi>Much of our time</hi> 
                        <note n="z" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Multum Temporis eripitur nobis, plus ſubducitur, plurimum effluit, exigua pars eſt vitae quam nos vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Seneca.</note> (ſaith one) <hi>is pluck'd away from us, more is ſtoln away, but moſt of all doth ſlide away. O how little a piece of life is that we live!</hi> How much of thy time hath been conſumed in the grave? How much in the market-place? much ſlept away in the Vineyard: When nature, ſelf, the world and ſin have had their ſhares of every day, how little a portion hath been left for God? Hence 'tis the Apoſtle adviſes Saints to redeem their Time; to get Time for God and their ſouls, though with ſome loſs to other intereſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath been taken captive by ſelf, ſin and the world, and held priſoner ſo long. This waſte of former Time makes it abſolutely needful for them that will reach their journey's end before their day be gone, to redeem Time from their callings, recreations, refreſhments, idleneſs and reſt, for the recovery of neglected work, or they will find it wanting when they come to die. <hi>Give me my time again,</hi> ſaid a woman on her death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, being under fears about her eternal ſtate; nothing could relieve her troubled ſoul, who had loſt ſalvation-time.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Conſider how ſhort and uncertain your remaining Time is, or may be: The whole
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:132285:230"/> Time of thy life is but a ſpan, a hand-breadth, a poſt, a weaver's ſhuttle, a vapour, a tale that is told, as a flower of the field, things of no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Job 9. 21. Pſal. 39. 5. James 4. 14. Time</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>is a ſhort parentheſis in a long period; ſo ſhort, that before we can name it, our preſent Time is become paſt Time. Our whole life</hi> (ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) <hi>conſiſts but of two daies, the day of our birth, and the day of our death;</hi> for no ſooner born, but we begin to die. Time is on the wing, haſtening to Eternity every moment: Time travels when you ſleep, and runs when you creep: Time goes on when you ſtop; and gets ground when you go back: As the ſtream haſtens to the Ocean day and night; ſo doth Time to Eternity: O uſe your Time for God while you have it! it will ſhortly be none of yours; if you do not uſe it, you will loſe it; you were as good let God have your Time, as to let it run away to no purpoſe; if duty do not improve it, ruſt will conſume it; the Devil, World and Fleſh will engroſs it; and 'tis better give it to God, than let the Moth and Caterpillar devour it. Beſides,</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Can you put it to better profit than to lay it out for God? he is the beſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for your Time; nothing will give you ſo much intereſt for Time as God will; put all the gain of other Time into the ſcale, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of God's Time, and you will ſoon ſee the difference. Time laid out for God will be the beſt ſecurity for your own Time: Give God his Time, and he will give you your Time; all that Time that is needful for a bleſſed Eternity; There's no ſuch way to enjoy Time, as to uſe it
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:132285:231"/> for God. <hi>Prov. 3. 16. Length of daies is in her right hand.</hi> Time expended for God will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecure, but ſanctifie your Time alſo, as the firſt-fruits did the lump, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. Beſides, Time devoted to God brings in eternal intereſt; Though Time be but a thing temporal, yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, it will bring to things eternal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. nay it will bring you mercy in the time of need: Give God your working-time, and he will feed you when in your unſerviceable time. <hi>When I was a young man</hi> (ſaid Mr. <hi>Bruce) I was diligent, and liv'd by faith in the Son of God, but now I am old, and am not able to do ſo much, yet he condeſcends to feed me with lumps of ſenſe.</hi> [Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill. of Scripture.]</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, you muſt give an account for your time to God; he takes notice of mens time, how 'tis ſpent; and accordingly will judg them: <hi>Luke 13. 7. Theſe three years I come ſeeking fruit on this Figtree, and can find none; cut it down, why cumbreth it the ground?</hi> Pſal. 95. 10. <hi>Forty years long was I grieved with this people.</hi> Luke 19. 44. <hi>Becauſe thou kneweſt not the time of thy viſitation.</hi> God looks for fruit from his people, according to their months, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 12. O how much is it your concernment to order your disburſements of time to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency with your comfortable account in the day of Chriſt! then you will wiſh God had more of your time, when you come to reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it: what a blank will there be in our account of time, if it be not better beſtowed than hitherto? That time will yield you moſt comfort when you come to eternity, which was ſpent for God here.</p>
                     <pb n="427" facs="tcp:132285:231"/>
                     <p>Sixthly, How can you bethink a little time for God, who hath not thought an eternity of mercy too much for you? Chriſtians, 'tis ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, with eternal glory, he hath prepared for you, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 10. A Crown incorruptible, an Inheritance that fadeth not away, a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken: Upon this very argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Apoſtle preſſes the Saints to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedneſs in preſent work, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 8. Think how diſingenuous 'tis thus to requite the Lord that hath dealt ſo bountifully with you; to with-hold your time from him, who firſt gave it to you, and hath denied it to others; and will ſhortly cloſe up your troublous time with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reſt, in bleſſed manſions of pureſt pleaſures with himſelf: Let this love of Chriſt ſhame you for miſimproved time, and conſtrain you, for the future, to lay out all poſſible time for God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Lay out your ſtrength for God; he is the God of your ſtrength, he hath right to it, and uſe for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43. 2. He hath work for you which calls for all your ſtrength: <hi>His works are great, greatly to be ſought out of all that have pleaſure therein,</hi> Pſal. 111. 2. <hi>His mercies are great, and greatly to be praiſed:</hi> Pſal. 86. 13. <hi>His anger is great, and greatly to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: 2 King.</hi> 23. 26. His trials and rebukes on his own children are many times great, which need great faith and patience to bear up under them, and the ſtrength of grace to make a right uſe of them: <hi>Pſal. 71. 10. Which hath ſhewn me great and ſore troubles:</hi> You do not know what need you may have of all the ſtrength your
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:132285:232"/> hearts and graces are capable to receive, to carry you through your remaining trials and troubles: you have not yet reſiſted unto blood, or been brought to fiery trials, nor ſeen ſuch days as never yet were or ſhall be And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had need be girded with ſtrength, and to be ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus; and one way to it, is to uſe what you have for God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14. God's ſervice alſo calls for expended ſtrength: <hi>Luke 10. 27. Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thy ſtrength, 1 Chron.</hi> 26. 8. The ſtrength of thy heart laid out, inward ſtrength for God in his ſervice, the ſtrength of your whole ſouls; and outward ſtrength, the ſtrength of your bodies alſo in the work of God. So did our Lord Jeſus, he waſted his ſtrength in the ſervice of his Father, that at thirty four years old, he was taken to be neer fifty: he was weary in his work. And <hi>Paul</hi> did ſpend, and was ſpent for Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15. And <hi>David</hi> cried out, <hi>My knees are weak through faſting,</hi> Pſal. 119. 24. <hi>Glorify God in your bodies, and in your ſpirits, which are the Lord's:</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20. <hi>In labours more abundant:</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 23. <hi>Striving for the faith of the Goſpel.</hi> Religion is no eaſy work; <hi>Miniſters</hi> (ſaith Mr. Burroughs) <hi>muſt venture their ſtrength for Chriſt,</hi> and ſo muſt all that are Chriſt's: 2. <hi>Cor. 11. 27. In wearineſs, in painfulneſs, in watchings.</hi> Religion is worth all your labours and exhauſted ſtrength; men tire themſelves for the world; how much more ſhould they for God and Glory?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Lay out your gifts and graces for God, and the good of ſouls: 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 7. The
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:132285:232"/> manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal:</hi> that's God's end why he gives gifts to any, that every one who hath them ſhould improve them to his glory, and the good of others. A capacity of ſerving God, and furthering his Kingdom in the World, is ſuch a priviledg as the Saints in Heaven enjoy not: and the Angels, when employed in any ſubſerviency towards it, readily and chearfully proſecute it. <hi>Angels are vigilant creatures, and wait for opportunities; and when they come, will not loſe them,</hi> [Greenh.] Yea, 'tis ſuch a prize, as being once loſt, can never be enjoyed again; nor gracious ſouls ever more return to their ſtewardſhip, when once 'tis given up; and therefore ſhould be heedfully regarded, and faithfully uſed whiles continued. God gives not talents to be napkin'd up, nor lights to be hid under a buſhel: none of us liveth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 7. All the characters of Saints, and thoſe relations they ſtand in, engage to uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: They are the lights of the world ſet in a candleſtick, that they may cauſe their light to ſhine forth before men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 14, 15. They are the ſalt of the earth, of purpoſe to ſavour others. <hi>Mat: 5. 13. If ſalt hath loſt its ſavour, 'tis good for nothing but the dunghil.</hi> They are ſtars in God's firmament, to communicate their light and influence unto others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 41. Veſſels in God's houſe to be meet for uſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20, 21. Stones in his building, which have a mutual uſefulneſs to bear up each other, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward preſerving the whole, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. Branches in the Vine, that yield their fruit for the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:132285:233"/> the hearts of men, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. 13. Trees in God's garden full of ſap, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 16. Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the body, to impart their nouriſhment to each other, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. and diſcharge their reſpective duties, of ſympathy, care, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to their fellow members: 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 14. We exhort you, brethren, to warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble minded, ſupport the weak, be patient towards all men:</hi> Uſe all your capacities for God while you have them, leſt he take them from you, or opportunity to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Lay out your earthly intereſts for God, <hi>Prov. 3. 19. Honour the Lord with thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and with the firſt fruits of thy encreaſe:</hi> Give God his due in maintaining his Meſſengers, and keeping up his worſhip; alluding to thoſe firſt fruits of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s encreaſe, which were the Lord's by ſpecial appropriation to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 29. and ſupply of his miniſtry among them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 20. the equity of which obliges in Goſpel-times, though their ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and judicial reſpect ceaſe: and this duty is reinforc'd under the Goſpel by more ample ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments taken from the light of Nature, the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and will of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. from <hi>ver.</hi> 9. to 15. To this head is referr'd that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; <hi>Gal. 6. 6. Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teacheth in all good things; for God will not be mocked:</hi> (as they do who pretend Religion, and yet are defective in this manifeſt duty,) preſſing them to unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in this expenſiveneſs for God, whatever diſcouragements they meet with upon the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:132285:233"/> of the bleſſed fruit of obedience to the will of Chriſt herein, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9. 'Tis not the maintaining or welfare of a few men in the World, that is the deſign of this great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt; but the tendency this hath to the promulgation of the Goſpel, and keeping up the inſtituted worſhip of God, the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sinners, and edification of Saints ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively in every generation, to which theſe ſupplies are neceſſary, that the ſervants of Chriſt might attend on their miniſtrations without diſtraction; and whoever (a ſubject of Chriſt, and ſharer of this priviledg) draws back from this duty, he is chargeable not only for viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the royal righteous law of Chriſt, but for being guilty of ſubverting his Government, Crown and Dignity; and endeavouring in his meaſure, the ruining his intereſt, of hindering the converſion and edification of ſouls; and whatever damage hereby comes to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or eternal welfare of ſouls; it will be laid on their heads in the day of the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Another greatly concerning duty contain'd in this Scripture, is charitable communications, feed the poor, feed the hungry, clothe the naked, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the oppreſſed.

Gregory</hi> the Great was ſo devoted to Charity, that all what he had ſeem'd to be the common granary of the Church. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> he was <hi>the blind man's eyes, the lame man's legs, the naked man's garment;</hi> he was a man of ſo great Charity.

A Duke being asked by ſome Ambaſſadors whether he could ſhew them ſome hunting-dogs, gathered a great many poor people together, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Ambaſſador, ſaid, Theſe be the Dogs I daily keep, and with which I uſe to

This is not your reſt, Mich.</hi> 2. 10. Chriſtians, you are not ſent hither to take root in the Earth, or with the Raven, let out of the Ark to build your neſts in the world; or with the fool in the Goſpel, to take your reſt in your full barns, and encreaſed goods; but as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſent before into <hi>Egypt</hi> to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for his own Countrey; and as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſhips were ſent to <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> to tranſport what materials were uſeful for the Houſe of God, and his own houſe. All that you are allowed here, is but as factorage for preſent maintenance: Some viands and refreſhments in the way, but your great buſineſs is to get ſuch goods as will vend in your own Countrey.

Seeing that ye look for ſuch things, be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without ſpot, and blameleſs.</hi> Heaven is a place of perfect holineſs, no unclean thing can enter there; which the eye of faith ſeeing, and the ſoul's right to it, puts a perſon upon perfecting his holineſs, that he may be ready to enter in. O then lay up hopes of glory, which have ſuch precious fruits hanging on them.</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what are thoſe ſure hopes of glory, which will never fail of glory; and from which we may expect ſuch excellent fruit?</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Firſt, Sure hopes of glory, which will never fail of glory, are iſſued out of a ſaving union with the Lord Jeſus, the Lord of glory. <hi>Col. 1. 27. To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this myſtery among the Gentiles; which is Chriſt in you the hope of glory.</hi> Chriſt united to you, and dwelling in you by his ſpirit, is this glorious treaſure ſpoken of in the former part of the verſe. Here are two arguments to endear the Lord Jeſus to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
                     <pb n="446" facs="tcp:132285:241"/>
                     <p>Firſt, That in their union with him they are inveſted with great and unſearchable treaſures; he himſelf being that glorious and hidden riches opened in the Goſpel, and made over to them in their reception of him into their hearts by faith; part of which treaſure they have in hand in their preſent union and communion with him, and the bleſſed fruits and conſequents of it here.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Another thing that renders Chriſt precious to Believers, is, that in their union with him is laid the foundation of their right to, and evidence of their hope of glory; [<hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus eſt in illis eatenus habent ſpem gloriae.</hi> Dav.] and aſſurance of their future and eternal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf, and all his treaſure laid up in glory: There's no other way to have a right to glory, but by union with Chriſt, who hath purchaſed glory onely for thoſe that are his, and have this ſpiritual union with him. Hence 'tis that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is called a better hope, <hi>John</hi> 17. 21, to 27. <hi>Heb. 7. 19. For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, by which we draw near to God:</hi> That is the Lord Jeſus in his Prieſtly Office, of which the Ceremonial Law was a forerunner, did bring in a ground of better hope in opening the way to God in grace and glory: All right to glory is through him who is the Lord of glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. and hath the diſpoſal of it to whom he pleaſes, <hi>John</hi> 17. 2. even to all the Father hath given him to be his; and to theſe he gives eternal life, <hi>John</hi> 10. 28. They that have union with Chriſt cannot periſh, being
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:132285:241"/> members of his body, fleſh and bones; ſhould a ſoul that hath received Chriſt here, miſs of glory hereafter, then would a member of Chriſt periſh, and his body in Heaven be maimed and imperfect, which cannot be, his Church being the fulneſs of him who filleth all in all, <hi>Eph. 1. v.</hi> 21. And Chriſt hath paſt his word for it they ſhall not periſh, <hi>John</hi> 10. 28. Not one of them is loſt who are truly in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 17. 10. They are his ſervants, and ſhall be where he is, <hi>John</hi> 12. 26. His Spouſe, which ſhall be ever with him. Try then your union with Chriſt; Have you received him into your hearts by faith? Are you one Spirit with him, having the ſame mind in you that was in Chriſt Jeſus? you would be holy as he is holy; nothing ſhort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat oneneſs with Chriſt can content you: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, you have carnal deſires within the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of your ſouls, that crave for ſatisfaction, and ſometimes will have it whether you will or no; but there is another Law in your mind warring againſt this Law in your members, that cannot reſt till you arrive more to his likeneſs, who is your life, righteouſneſs and glory. Are you implanted into Chriſt's death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, brought into ſome conformity to him? And do you live upon him as the branch upon the root for all your grace and ſupply, and ſtay upon him as the ſtone upon the foundation, for your ſupport in grace unto glory, as your onely Lord and Righteouſneſs? Then are your hopes for glory ſure ſpeeding hopes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Truth of grace ſecures your hopes of glory, it being the earneſt, ſeal, and firſt
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:132285:242"/> fruits of glory. 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 22. Who hath alſo ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and given the earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi> Grace is God's ſeal for glory, and what greater ſecurity can there be? 'Tis his earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny, which is never taken away, as a pledge may be, but ſecures the whole ſumme; yea 'tis part of pay: Grace is that ſeed of God which remaineth in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 9. and ſecures the ſoul's ſtate againſt final Apoſtacy, through its union with the Spirit dwelling in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. Prove your truth of grace (though never ſo weak) and you will prove your title to glory: Doth your grace owe its being to the fulneſs of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 1 16. owning its derivation thence; and dependance there? Doth your grace ſpread it ſelf into every part and faculty of your ſoul, wholly ſanctified throughout? 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 23. Cannot your grace mingle with ſin, or own the leaſt appearance of evil, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 2. but hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its meaſure an irreconcilable enmity againſt every known ſin? <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. Cannot your grace reſt in any meaſures ſhort of perfection, but hath deſires and endeavours after more and more grace? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. Hath your grace pure and ultimate deſigns for Divine Glory, aiming in every thing, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20, 21. that Chriſt may be magnified, <hi>John</hi> 3. 30. and ſelf annihil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated? then is your grace true grace, and will in time turn to glory.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Your mortifiedneſs to the world will be a good proof of your title to Heaven. The heirs of Glory are choſen out of the world; are not of the world, <hi>John</hi> 15. 19. Redeemed from the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 3. They have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:132285:242"/> the ſpirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12. and are crucified to it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. dead to the deſires, pleaſures and intereſts of this world, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. Dead men have no favour or delight in things; no more have they who are dead to this world, any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcing pleaſure in earthly things, which can no more ſatisfie a heavenly ſoul, than dung can feed a living man. Chriſtians, try how your hearts ſtand affected to earthly things; are theſe great in your eye, amiable to your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, attractive on your deſires, prevalent on your wills, beyond the things of Heaven? then are your hopes of Heaven unwarrantable by any Divine evidence, and will at laſt leave your names written on the earth.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Your hopes for Heaven, if right, will be active lively hopes. 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 3. Who hath begotten us again to a lively hope, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt from the dead.</hi> Hopes that put life in your affections <note n="i" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>id eſt, vivificam ſcilicet quae vivificat Metonymia Effecti.</hi> Piſcat.</note> and ſpirits, and makes you vigorous after holineſs, and the way to glory, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 10. Right hopes for Heaven will make you run in the way to Heaven, and put you on all manner of holy converſation. <hi>Paul</hi>'s hopes for Heaven put him on labours and ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after perfect holineſs, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 8, 9. Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14. Try your hopes; do they quicken you to duty, or leave you dead? You have no heart to the waies of God, or delight in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to him; his commands are grievous to you; this beſpeaks unſound and frail hopes
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:132285:243"/> for Heaven, which will at laſt deceive you: But ſure hopes for Heaven are back'd with ſuitable labours for Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, If your hopes be right for Heaven, then will your converſation be in Heaven. <hi>Phil. 3. 20. But our converſation is in Heaven, whence alſo we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile bodies, that it may be faſhioned like to his glorious body.</hi> You will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about heavenly things, and driving on heavenly concerns: You will be maintaining en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe in Heaven, and keeping up your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with God; you will be often taking journeys to Heaven in your contemplations and deſires; your buſineſs will be much in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and your occaſions thither frequent; though you live on Earth, yet you will converſe in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. As Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> ſaid when he was near death, <hi>I ſhall but change my place, not my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi> O try your hopes for Heaven by your converſation, if that be engaged about the things of Heaven now; if your work be in Heaven, your reſt ſhall be in Heaven alſo.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, If your hopes for Heaven be right, you will willingly undergo whatſoever ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and dangers lye in your way to Heaven. He that is ſure of reaching home at laſt, will venture through any dangers in his way. O what hazards will men run through to get an earthly Crown! no difficulties will diſcourage them; how much more will hopes for Heaven carry ſouls through the Red Sea of afflictions and bloody ſufferings they may meet with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to it! <hi>Acts 20. 24. chap.</hi> 21. 13.
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:132285:243"/> He that cannot conſent to drink of the cup Chriſt drinks of, and which the Father ſhall give him to drink, and to ſubmit to the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elleſt death, loſſes, ſhame, tryals and torments, which his faithfulneſs to God may bring him to, muſt reckon again, and take up other conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions about his future ſtate; eaſier terms can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be granted: <hi>Whoſoever he be of you that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> Luke 14. 33. <hi>He that will come after me, muſt deny himſelf, take up his Croſs, and follow me.</hi> Matth. 16. 24. <hi>We muſt through much tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Acts 14. 22. <hi>If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall reign with him,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 12.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Lay up deſires for glory, not only ſome deſires of glory, but ſuch deſires as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can ſatisfie but glory; which nothing ſhort of a whole God can content. Moſt ſouls in this life limit their deſires, and take up their wiſhes too ſhort of true bleſſedneſs: <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God</hi> (ſaith God) but it was only for ſome ſights of his <hi>power and glory, as he had ſeen him in his Sanctuary,</hi> Pſal. 63. 1, 3. Some looks through the lattice; ſome embraces of Chriſt in the arms of faith, pleaſed the Spouſe, and doth ſatisfie moſt ſouls here: Alas, how few are the deſires of gracious ſouls, which a little of God will not content! One deſires grace, another peace; ſome are for quickenings and comforts; others for enlightenings, for higher meaſures of knowledge, for ſome ſights of God through a glaſs; but how few breathings are there, to ſee as we are ſeen, to know as we are
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:132285:244"/> known? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. And indeed 'tis ſtrange that Heaven-born ſouls, that heirs of glory, and fellow-citizens of Heaven, ſhould have no more longings after their own home, and not onely for ſome firſt-fruits, but the full ripe fruits of their own Countrey. <hi>David</hi> had ſometimes workings after this, not only for God to come to him, but for himſelf to go to God; when his heart takes a leap from the path of life, into the preſence of God, where is fulneſs of joy, and pleaſures for evermore. <hi>Pſal. 16. 11. Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life: in thy preſence is fulneſs of joy, at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> From the beholding of his face in righteouſneſs here, he longs for the ſatisfying viſions of God in glory. <hi>Pſal. 17. 15. As for me, I will behold thy face in righteouſneſs; I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs. Paul</hi> alſo under the higheſt enjoyments of God here, had his unſatisfied longings to be with him as beſt of all, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. and in reſpect of which he counts his greateſt intimacy with Chriſt in the body, to be a kind of abſence. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 6. Knowing that whiles we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord.</hi> Do not terminate your deſires upon any thing that can ſatisfie you on this ſide glory: Get ſuch deſires raiſed, which cannot be anſwered till you come to Heaven, with ſuch kind of breathings as theſe: <hi>O when ſhall I come to that bleſſed ſtate, to know as I am known; to have every corner of my heart filled with the immediate emanations of his glorious fulneſs! O when will that time, or rather eternity come, when I ſhall be ſatisfied with looking on
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:132285:244"/> that bleſſed face which is every day the Angels wonder, and the Saints joy. Here alas! I lie among the pots, all ſooty and defiled, whiles the veſſels of my Father's houſe, and the bowls before the Altar, out of which my Lord alway drinketh, are bright and glorious. Now I have my habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where Dragons lie, while a glorious Pavilion ſtands empty for me: Here I feed on my own dung, and oft-times eat the excrements of Devils, and all the while there's bread enough in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, and my Brethren fare deliciouſly at the King's Table. O when ſhall my work be done, that I may be gone! When ſhall the things for cleanſing be given me, and the daies of my puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication be accompliſhed, that my turn may come to go in to the Lord my King! When ſhall the Nuptial garments, the Bridal ornaments, the Robe, the Ring, the Royal Veſtments beſpangled with coſtly Jewels, be given me, with this moſt welcome meſſage, Ariſe my Love, my Dove, my Fair One, and come away!</hi> Lay up ſuch kind of breathings after the Mountains of Spices, the Everlaſting Hills, the Rivers of Pleaſures, the Bride-chamber of Glory, where you ſhall be ever with the Lord. <note n="k" place="bottom">Glory, Glory dwelleth in <hi>Immanuel</hi>'s Land, <hi>Rutherford</hi>'s laſt words.</note> This will haſten your pace to Heaven, and mount you on the wings of a Dove: This will help you to paſs by the world's glory with a holy ſcorn, and to bear its cruelty with incredible patience.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Lay up all the Treaſures you can to greaten glory: Though the leſt portion of glory is ſatisfying, yet the higheſt meaſures of
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:132285:245"/> glory are deſirable, becauſe in it there is the greateſt conformity to God, 1 <hi>John 3. 2. Luke 10. 17, 19, 20. Dan.</hi> 12. 3. and the fulleſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God. The Lord Jeſus doth propoſe degrees of glory for the encouragement of his people to greater improvements of grace; and therefore the higheſt degrees of glory are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable: O get as much as you can here to greaten your felicity in Heaven. Do all you may to make your Crown more maſſy, and your manſion more fair, and your pleaſures more full to all Eternity.</p>
                     <p>Several things have a tendency to greaten your glory. The more grace you improve now, the greater will be your glory; he that gained ten pounds, had ten Cities: Grace is ſeed ſown, according to its meaſure will be the harveſt: <hi>What a man ſows, that ſhall he reap,</hi> Gal. 6. 7. The leſs ſeed is ſown, the leſs crop will there be; and the more ſeed, the larger encreaſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9. Glory is a Crown of Righteouſneſs proportioned to the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of Grace. The more work you do for God, the greater will be your wages of grace in glory, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 2, 4. 2 Cor. 5. 10. That every one ſhould receive according to what is done in the body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The more you lay out for God, the more ſhall you receive from him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. who will certainly repay it.</p>
                     <p>The greater your ſufferings are for God, the greater will your rejoycings be with him: <hi>They that ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy, Pſ.</hi> 126. 5. Look what diſproportion there is between the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:132285:245"/> Seed-time and Harveſt, far greater is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Saints ſufferings, ſorrows, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing joy: Their ſorrow lies within the compaſs of a ſhort night, their joy begins with that morning which hath no evening to follow it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 5. Their tears will ſcarcely fill a bottel, but their pleaſures are ſo vaſt an Ocean, as that they cannot be received, but muſt be entred into, <hi>Mat. 25. 21. Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 17. Yea the preſent conſolations of the Saints oft-times abound in their ſufferings; <hi>The ringing of my chains hath been ſweet muſick in my ears,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Guy de Bres;) all my former diſcourſes were but as a blind man's of colours, in reſpect of my preſent feeling: O what a precious comforter is a good conſcience!</hi> How unſpeakable then are thoſe rejoycings, when all tears ſhall be wiped off, when ſorrow and mourning ſhall fly away, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12.</p>
                     <p>The more your loſſes are for Chriſt on earth, the greater will be your gain in Heaven. <hi>Heb. 10. 34. And took joyfully the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing in your ſelves that you have in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a better and an enduring ſubſtance.</hi> Men can never bring their goods to a better Market, than to have them ſpoil'd for the ſake of Chriſt: your goods you loſe for Chriſt are capable of being ſpoil'd; your goods you ſhall receive in Heaven are above all injury; the very <hi>bags wax not old,</hi> much leſs the treaſure: time will mar your beſt intereſts here. Alas, what is a little old goods, moth-eaten garments, ruſty ſilver
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:132285:246"/> ſubject to change; compared with that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whoſe duration is as long as eternity, and whoſe extenſion is as large as immenſity? and ſuch is God in Chriſt, the Saints eternal treaſure: <hi>Mat. 19. 29. And in the World to come life eternal.</hi> Carnal reaſon judges them the greateſt fools that dare to be undone for their profeſſion; whereas divine truth reckons ſuch the mad men, who to eſcape them that can but kill the body, durſt encounter him who can damn both ſoul and body in Hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 28. And to lay a foundation of a few days ſafety upon the ruines of themſelves and others. <hi>How dangerous</hi> (ſaid Mr. <hi>Cooper) is their eſtate, who cannot riſe but with the fall of many?</hi> Et quantulum ſit illud propter quod nos reliquiſti? <hi>How poor are thoſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for which you have left us?</hi> whereas the Saints loſſes for Chriſt are their greateſt gain, while the things they part with are but temporal; but thoſe they gain are eternal, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The more ſouls you help to Heaven, the more treaſure you prepare for Heaven: <hi>Dan. 12. 3. They that be wiſe</hi> (the margin hath it, they that be teachers) <hi>ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteouſneſs, as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi> As nothing doth ſink a perſon deeper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, than to have the blood of ſouls upon its head, and to become the occaſion of others periſhing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 34. So it wonderfully greatens a perſons own bleſſedneſs in Heaven, to be the means of getting others to be bleſſed alſo: 1 <hi>Theſ. 2. 19. For what is our hope, or joy, or
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:132285:246"/> crown of rejoycing? are not even you in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of our Lord Jeſus Christ at his coming? for ye are our glory and joy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Lay up preparations for glory: Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is a great thing: O what a change doth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven make upon a Believer's ſtate! <hi>We ſhall all be changed, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 51. from corruption to incorruption; from ſin to ſpotleſs purity; from imperfection to pefection; from darkneſs to knowledg; from faith to fight; from eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to a marriage-day: and what preparations do ſuch a change call for? What if death ſhould ſurpriſe you, and take you in your old clothes? 'tis not your daily garments, no not your beſt rayments are good enough for your marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: your attire muſt be all new when you ſolemnize your eternal nuptials to the King of Glory. O what manner of perſons ſhould you be who look for new Heavens, and a new Earth! If a <hi>Paul</hi> be not ſufficient to carry a love-token to Chriſt's Spouſe here on earth, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 16. Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> Who then are fit to lie in the Bridegroom's arms to all eternity? Few think what a change muſt be before the Saints can get to Heaven: 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 50. Fleſh and blood cannot inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</hi> If ſo much preparation-work muſt be diſpatch'd before an <hi>Eſther</hi> could be fit for the embraces of an earthly King, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 2. 12. ſix months for purifying with oyl of Myrrh, and ſix months with ſweet Odors, and with other things? How much ſanctification-work is needful to meeten a ſoul for the immediate
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:132285:247" rendition="simple:additions"/> enjoyment of God in glory? and how unready are the moſt of ſouls for ſuch a change? O Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers! haſten about your preparations for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſeeing you have no fixation on earth, and know not what hour your Lord will come. In order to which, take theſe ſix directions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Get your hearts more looſe from this preſent world; men that change places, knock up, and take abroad things they muſt carry with them: Your hearts (Chriſtians) are the principal things you muſt take with you to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; it may be you have gone to God in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties many a time, and left your hearts behind you; but you cannot go to God in glory, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your hearts be with you. And O what a difficult work is it to go the heart (upon choice) looſe from every thing below God! and till this be done, there's no getting to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Things faſtened to the free-hold (they ſay) cannot be removed; how then can that heart get to glory, that is nailed down to the world, and things below. Be daily looſening your hearts from the world, eſtates, houſes, lands, trades, friends, relations, and every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; for you may not have time to get them off without loſs, when death comes: you muſt leave them all ſhortly, and you know not how ſoon, to go to better friends and intereſts: theſe have been ſnares and ſpears to your ſouls, and have given you many a wound, and ſtill hinder your ſpeeding to glory; and why ſhould you be loth to part with them? O Chriſtians! if you are willing to be with Chriſt, you will give your hearts warning to be gone from theſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:132285:247"/> and to take their leave of this world daily.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Preſs after more maturity in your graces; the more ripe, the more fit for gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Joel. 3. 13. Tamar</hi> muſt tarry a Widow till <hi>Selah</hi> be grown, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 11. and your marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day muſt be delayed till you come to a full age: The Saints muſt be as a ſhock of corn that cometh in in its ſeaſon, <hi>Job</hi> 5. 25. Ripen a pace in your graces, if you would get to glory: Get your faith, hope, patience, and every grace encreaſed daily; eſpecially your love to God; that's the grace ſhall abide in glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. Faith and Hope are the ſoul's helps, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in the way; but Love will be an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inhabitant with you. Get purer, deeper rooted, ſtronger, more enlarged love to Jeſus Chriſt every day, till you be downright ſick for him; this will make your life a death without his preſence here, and your death to be life in being with him for ever. 'Twas love to Chriſt made <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſo dead to all things below, <note n="a" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Vita ſine Chriſto mors eſt;</hi> Ignat.</note> and ſo longing to be with Chriſt: 'Tis ſtoried of him, that when he was dead, and his heart taken out, they ſaw the name of Jeſus written in it in letters of Gold: The more love to God, the more fit for God; <hi>for God is love,</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Non eſt in me incendium quidpiam amans;</hi> D. Ludov. Rub.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Get and keep the teſtimony of a good conſcience, that may witneſs for you in the day of Chriſt: when you die, you are to have a trial for your life, your inheritance, your All; and you had need have your wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:132285:248"/> firm, and ready: Now there are two great witneſſes you will need in that day to clear your title; the witneſs of Conſcience, and the Spirit: have the one on your ſide, and you will not want the other. Get your conſciences ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt, and purged from dead works by the Spirit of Chriſt, that it may be able to appear for you in that day. The blood of Chriſt will put words into the mouth of conſcience for you, to plead the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral iſſue, and the benefit of pardoning grace, wherein you have been tranſgreſſors; enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned conſcience will accuſe you that you have ſinned; and beſprinkled conſcience will plead for you that you are pardoned; and purged conſcience will teſtify for you that you are changed, and that you hate the evil you have done, and love the holineſs you have neglected. O of what wonderful uſe will the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a good conſcience be when you ſtand at the Bar of God! Get it true to you now, and ſure for you then.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Maintain more conſtant walks with God daily; this will fit you for your eternal fellowſhip with him. Converſe with God is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun acquaintance here; and in Heaven is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect friendſhip, and perpetual fellowſhip. It will much fit you for Heaven hereafter, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the work of Heaven here, which lies in maintain'd intercourſe with him. Through theſe gallery-walks with God, do the Saints paſs into the Preſence-Chamber, and ſit down with him for ever: Communion with God now, is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven begun; ſuch are fitteſt for his preſence in
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:132285:248"/> glory, who are train'd up in his company here.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, If you would prepare for Heaven, diſpatch your work on Earth: Heaven is a ſtate of reſt, and reſt follows the finiſhing of labour, <hi>Heb. 4. 9. Rev. 4. 13. Paul</hi> muſt end his fight, finiſh his courſe, and keep the faith, before he can reach the Crown: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8. In the grave there's no wiſdom, device, or work; this is your only time for labour while you are in the Vineyard. O how much work is behind with moſt! which will make a departure terrible to an awakened conſcience. Haſte about your neglected work; you have (it may be) much work to do with others, in your families, with your relations; poſſibly there are ſome ſouls in their graves, and you have not done what you might to bring them forth; dead Husband, Wife, Children, Servants, for whom you muſt do more, or cannot comfortably appear before God. O haſten about this work, that you may give up your account with joy! There's ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work to be done, to get corruptions ſubdued, graces ſtrengthned, your accounts ſtated, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences cleared, and lamps trimmed, which muſt be attended with utmoſt vigour. If you would get home, finiſh your work.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Be alwaies ready, waiting for the coming of the Lord: <hi>Luke 12. 35, 36. Let your loins be girt about, and your lights burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ye your ſelves like unto men, that wait for their Lord when he will return from the Wedding; that when he cometh, and knocketh, they may open to him immediately:</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 12. <hi>Looking for,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:132285:249"/> and haſtening to the coming of the day of God:</hi> Not only be waiting for your change, but long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it, as perſons that are ready for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired journey think the time long ere they go. <hi>Why are the wheels of his Chariot ſo long a coming?</hi> Judg. 5. 28. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay come,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. <hi>With the Virgins go out to meet him,</hi> Mat. 25. 1. <hi>If you knew the welcome that abideth for you when you come home, ye would haſten your pace;</hi> Rutherf. The more ready you are for the coming of Chriſt, the more will you long for his appearance; and the more grateful will his approach be. The uncertainty of that time when the Lord Jeſus ſhall appear, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonableneſs of that ſurpriſal for preparation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, ſhould put Chriſtians on continual readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, leſt coming in an hour they know not of, they be found unfit to enter in, and the door be ſhut, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 10.</p>
                     <p>O how dreadful will a miſcarriage be at laſt! All the hopes, labours and comfort of your life depend upon your final ſafety, and happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of your day: 'Tis a great thing to live a ſanctified, and die a ſaved ſoul. O how few ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the difficulty of being a Chriſtian indeed, and the infinite concern of ſecuring an immortal ſoul, and a ſure title to the unſearchable riches of the other world! O the folly and madneſs of rational creatures, to make every thing ſure but ſalvation, and to ſpend their time and ſtrength about the many things of a periſhing life, and loſe the better part! Whoever thou art that caſteſt thine eye upon this diſcourſe, thou wilt one day find Religion to be thy chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:132285:249"/> intereſt; when thou comeſt to take thy fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel of a vain deceitful world, and ſeeſt all thy Lovers, for whom thou haſt ſleighted thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul, thy Soverign Lord, and dying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, to prove miſerable comforters, not able to afford one drop of balm, to heal, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial to chear thy fainting heart, and affrighted conſcience: When thou ſeeſt pale death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee a ſummons to appear before the holy God, and to give an account of thy Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when thou ſeeſt the Books opened, and ſuch a fearful charge againſt thy guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which thou canſt not deny or anſwer; then wilt thou find godlineſs in the power of it, to be the greateſt gain; and would'ſt give ten thouſand worlds for ſuch an evidence as <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had, when within view of death and eternity. And is not Religion as much thy concern, and ſhould be as grateful now, and all thoſe great and important duties of piety which this Book laies before thee; thought to be as adviſable now, when time and capacity may render them feaſible, as in a dying hour, when deſires and purpoſes may be too late? O do not content thy treacherous heart, to caſt a tranſient glance upon theſe lines, to approve or commend them, and after all to ſhake hands with theſe vaſt and concerning Truths in them, and live and die a ſtranger to this great and heavenly work; but reſolve to ſet about it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, to purſue it throughly, that when your Trading-day is done, your enriching Eternity may begin, and you receive that vaſt Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that fadeth not away, eternal in the Heavens.</p>
